ACL RoboLoCo organized community-focused initiatives, volunteering events, STEM competitions, advocacy-driven initiatives, and online resources. ACL RoboLoCo has continued its commitment to community-centered outreach. In partnership with the Loudoun Literacy Council, Wolf Trap, Head Start and STEP, we hosted 4 book parties where we reached over 400 underserved preschoolers, reaching 800 total in the past 2 years. We created a new book called Don\u2019t Judge a Robot by Its Rust to expand our demographics and reach new children, encouraging STEM collaboration. Additionally, we hosted STEAM night displays at elementary schools in Loudoun County including Sugarland Elementary, Hillside Elementary, and Lincoln Elementary where we had robot demos and engaging STEM activities. ACL RoboLoCo expanded its community outreach this season by partnering with new organizations. We partnered with the National Society of Black Engineers Jr. (NSBE Jr.) to host 2 full-day events aimed at Title I students. The first event included coding Finch robots to draw shapes, allowing them to learn the basics of programming and robotics. During the second event, the children worked together to create a robotic petting zoo, where they used Hummingbird Bit kits to build and code robots that resembled animals\u2019 appearances and behaviors. To increase STEM awareness, we attended conferences to advocate for STEM in our communities. On the state level, ACL RoboLoCo members organized and attended the Virginia STEM Advocacy Seminar with Blue Cheese Robotics. All 140 Virginia legislators attended this conference, where we helped advocate for legislation such as the STEM+C Competition Team Grant Program and FIRST Robotics Day Resolution. We plan to attend SASA\u2019s National Advocacy Conference in June, where participants will conference with members of Congress to expand and improve STEM opportunities for underserved and underrepresented communities around the country. We also attended the Inspire Loudoun conference, where we introduced plans to integrate STEM and robotics into teacher lesson plans. We also hosted a workshop at the conference, detailing ways to start up FRC and FTC teams at their schools. At the Stone Springs Robotic Takeover, we showcased our robot and team, connecting to medical professionals and demonstrating the links between the medical and robotics fields. ACL RoboLoCo also presented at the FIRST Expo, where we discussed what we do as a competitive robotics team and how we give back to our community. Additionally, at this expo, we distributed the remaining LEGOs collected from last year\u2019s FLL LEGO drive, giving new teams the materials they need to begin building their robots. ACL RoboLoCo also participated in other community events, demonstrating our commitment to expanding STEM and inspiring more children. We worked to coordinate volunteering at the ACL Hour of Code, hosted by the ACL Computer Science Honor Society. To further our outreach events beyond our local community, we continued to expand with our podcast, where we recently released season 3 of Robocast featuring FRC teams across the country. Furthermore, we also updated our virtual robotics resource bank, FIRST STEPS, helping provide vital startup information to upcoming rookie FRC teams. ACL RoboLoCo members also participated in two key STEM volunteering opportunities this year. Members were at the Propel/Level Up VEX Robotics Competition hosted at the Academies of Loudoun to volunteer at various stations and help ensure the competition ran smoothly. Members were also at the Propel/Level Up Innovation Day event where they volunteered and helped showcase the various innovations. Please tell us about your season: With the start of the academic year and the preseason in August, the Academies of Loudoun RoboLoCo jumped straight into their work, passionately engaging in recruitment initiatives and planning outreach opportunities. Through club fairs, interest meetings, shoutouts, social media posts, word of mouth, and even past outreach efforts, we were able to successfully recruit over a hundred new interested students during the preseason. With so many recruits coming from different schools across Loudoun County with varying knowledge and experience in robotics, ACL RoboLoCo hosted weekly workshops where members would engage in a one-hour session on a technical workshop (mechanical/software) of their choice, followed by another one-hour session on a nontechnical workshop (business/creative) of their choice. These workshops teach new and returning members the necessary skills to excel during competition season, as well as give students the option to pursue a technical and nontechnical subject according to their interests, strengths, and weaknesses. Additionally, our preseason workshops are an excellent example of our interdisciplinary nature and efforts to equalize technical and nontechnical subteams. Besides hosting workshops for members to develop and hone their skills in the preseason, ACL RoboLoCo members worked tirelessly to plan and carry out outreach events. During the 4 months between the start of workshops and the start of the competition season, ACL RoboLoCo conducted four book parties at public libraries for preschoolers. ACL RoboLoCo also planned and prepared for months for the NSBE Jr events. The two NSBE Jr events helped introduce underrepresented students in Loudoun County to robotics through a \u201crobotics petting zoo\u201d and Hummingbird kits. ACL RoboLoCo also published and planned multiple episodes to upload for their 3 rd season on RoboCast. Additionally, ACL RoboLoCo sent out biweekly newsletters to ensure our sponsors and members were updated on the team's activities. We also hosted a sponsor night where we demonstrated the robot and discussed our season's progress with sponsors. Moreover, ACL RoboLoCo hosted STEAM nights at Sugarland, Hillside, and Lincoln Elementary School, presented at the Inspire Loudoun Conference, hosted the Stone Springs robotics takeover, and organized an FLL tournament at the Academies of Loudoun. They also attended the Virginia STEM Advocacy Seminar, advocating to over 140 delegates regarding STEAM bills in Virginia, leading to the establishment of the STEM+C Competition Grant Program. Along with outreach initiatives and spreading STEM awareness, ACL RoboLoCo members fundraised money to help the team with its yearlong expenses. For example, we held concession stands at the FLL tournaments that we organized, effectively fundraised over $1.2k in our annual Krispy Kreme fundraiser, and collected another $1.2k in our ACL RoboLoCo Spring Car Wash at Roy Rogers. Then, following an electrifying kickoff on Jan 6, ACL RoboLoCo was charged up for the new season! The team swiftly delved into game analysis, meticulously strategized the robot\u2019s design and capabilities, and initiated the drafting process for the Impact award and other submitted awards. ACL RoboLoCo attended the Week 3 and 4 competitions, which led us to qualify for the District Championship. During the Week 3 competition, ACL RoboLoCo had an 8-4 win record in our qualification matches, putting us in 5 th place. We were the 3 rd alliance captain in the semi-finals and won 2 matches out of 4 before getting knocked out due to issues with our intake. However, ACL RoboLoCo earned the Excellence in Engineering award for the simple yet effective design that included strategies to reduce breakage. Our technical subteams promptly fixed the intake issue in time for the Week 4 competition. ACL RoboLoCo also competed for Impact at Week 3, where our impact team showcased what outreach we\u2019ve done this year and our plans to grow. At the Week 4 competition, we had a 10-2 win record in the qualification matches, placing us in 3 rd place. ACL RoboLoCo was the 2 nd alliance captain and won 2 matches out of 4, and we were eliminated when one of our alliance partners was disabled during the last match. Week 4 was also our second presentation for Impact, and though we did not advance through the award, our robot\u2019s success led us to qualify for the District Championship. Here, ACL RoboLoCo had an 8-4 win record, placing us in 9 th place out of 54 teams. This season was ACL RoboLoCo\u2019s first time qualifying for the District Championship semi-finals, and we qualified as the 8 th alliance captain. Our alliance had a 1-2 win record, with minimal robot issues that were fixed by our pit team. Overall, this season was an overwhelming success for ACL RoboLoCo, especially considering it is our first year using a swerve drivetrain, and we hope to continue to excel next season. The mechanical subteam employed their expertise throughout the season by thoughtfully considering all elements of the game and building techniques, striving for mechanical success. New mechanical members were swiftly introduced to concepts of design and assembly during Bunnybots, our off-season competition. After kickoff, mechanical members began brainstorming using slideshows and KrayonCAD to quickly visualize their ideas, getting input from the entire team. The mechanical subteam also established a multi-doc organizational system in OnShape to streamline the CAD process. To narrow down on a final design, they tested the geometry and dimensions of several archetypes. They also created a part naming system and organizational spreadsheet, helping them manufacture over 100 custom parts in house at the ACL Maker Space. Next, the mechanical subteam skillfully assembled the robot, iterating on it throughout the season. During the spring season, they also began building the kitbot for the current game, which will be a demonstration robot. The software subteam developed a unique electrical board for our 2024 robot, Rock N\u2019 Rivets. They also did this during the off-season for our Bunnybots robot. Software coded both the autonomous and human-operated modes; they also dedicated efforts to develop and enhance ACL RoboLoCo\u2019s new competition scouting app. Their hard work extended to testing our Limelight sensors, developing LED features, and wiring the robot. Furthermore, they developed code for the team\u2019s outreach robot, creating a \u201ckid-friendly\u201d mode to ensure safety at outreach events. Coming to the nontechnical side of ACL RoboLoCo, the business subteam started off the competition season by drafting their Impact Award essay while continuing outreach events and fundraisers. This included working on and expanding the current outreach initiatives, including RoboCast, FIRST STEPS, FLL Tournaments, newspapers, etc. Alongside the Impact Award, the business subteam worked on other awards such as Woodie Flowers and Dean\u2019s List. In addition to the Impact Award Essay, the team worked together on the Impact Award video and presentation, business binders, one-pagers, and preparation for the Engineering Inspiration Award. The creative subteam worked incredibly hard this season by creating various 3D animations for award submissions and display purposes. They submitted a 3D digital animation using Blender, and creative also made an animation depicting our 2023-2024 robot in motion. Additionally, the creative subteam created new pin designs (including subteam-specific buttons) and animated the Impact Award video submission. Our creative subteam designed the illustrations for our new book Don\u2019t Judge a Robot by Its Rust, where they collaborated with business to design the book. They also drew our annual leadership poster, stickers, and community partners banner, all materials we display and give out at competitions. There were also several mechanical-creative collaborations, such as spray painting the robot and creating our robot one-pager, which we started this year to show our robot\u2019s skills and the techniques used. We wrapped up our season with an end-of-year celebration with team members, mentors, parents, and sponsors. We celebrated our graduating seniors and hosted an awards ceremony for our mentors. ACL RoboLoCo had an extremely successful and fun season, and we aim to grow our success, outreach, and achievements in the following years. We greatly thank the Intuitive Foundation for their immense support, and we hope to see you return for the 2024-2025 FRC season.","title":"Intuitive Grant Final Report ACL RoboLoCo2023 2024 Season"},{"location":"Competition%20Season/Business/Impact%20Award/Judging%20Questions/","text":"3Last years: impact presentation script Personal Questions: What does FIRST mean to you? What are your plans after high school/college? What did you do on the team this year? How does the FIRST program impact you directly? Team Questions: How is your team sustainable? Our team has a specific leadership structure which includes subteam leaders to manage different parts of the team. These subteam leaders document progress on different projects and work. Additionally our team works on receiving grants and funding from organizations as well as our own fundraising events. With the use of hands-on workshops we train/recruit new members so they get the knowledge they need before joining the team itself. Lastly, our team constantly evolves to meet the needs of our community. For example, our team hosted a Lego Drive to collect lego donations to give to local FLL teams.

RoboLoco has many gracious sponsors such as: Academies of Loudoun, DOD STEM, BAE Systems, Intuitive Foundation, Northrop Grumman, Toyon Research Corp. These sponsors provide our team with monetary funding, physical resources like the ACL Makerspace, and mentors who guide our team members. Academies of Loudoun, DOD STEM, BAE Systems, Intuitive Foundation, Northrop Grumman, Toyon Research Corp. Provide team with funding, physical resources (ACL Makerspace), mentors (Judith(BAE Systems)) What is your team\u2019s greatest accomplishment? [b] Our team\u2019s biggest accomplishment was the addition of our non-technical subteams: business and creative. It was so impactful to the team that in just 5 years, 2019 to 2024, it grew by more than 30 members. Currently, business still impacts the team by doing season essays and playing a big role in outreach events, like making books for book parties and planning hour of codes. Creative makes artistic season submissions, like the impact video, and makes team spirit, like shirts and buttons, that are used at outreach events and in the team. Establishment of our team\u2019s nontechnical subteams from 2 members in 2019 to almost 35 in 2024 Nontechnical subteams allowed us to have more outreach from business (ex. Book Parties, Hour of Code, FLL Competitions) as well as spirit (Shirts, buttons, pins) If they ask for another accomplishment\u2026 Our team's structure ensures that each and every member on the team feels welcome. We\u2019ve almost doubled our team size in the past few years, and still, every member is able to participate. i\u2019m [c] What makes your team unique? There are numerous things that make our team unique. First of all, we host pre-season workshops for interested students to find which subteam suits them. In addition, our holistic nature connects technical and non-technical subteams together by organizing software outreach events, and custom bumpers. Finally, we create entry points to robotics through outreach and events. Our interdisciplinary approach allows students interested in joining our team to find a sub-team which fits their strengths. We do this by letting new members attend multiple technical and non-technical workshops during the preseason. Our holistic nature connects both technical and non technical subteams Business creating software-related outreach events Creative designing bumpers Creating more entry points into robotics through outreach and events What obstacles have you overcome as a team? The obstacles that we have overcome are that too many potential members were interested, so we had to limit the number we accepted. Before, we had difficulty planning outreach and promoting team spirit, so we created the business and creative subteams. Finally, new members were inexperienced during the competition season, so we created preseason projects for them to learn from. A high volume of potential members wanting to join the team, but not enough roles on our team to give everyone a spot 100+ new recruits each season Establishment of our sub-teams Preseason projects which assist with the team\u2019s sustainability goal providing members with valuable hands on experience Where do you see your team going in the future? [d] Our team strives to improve and constantly meet the needs of our community. Our nontechnical subteams have been working on reaching a larger audience through outreach events. We plan to enhance our non tech and tech subteams. Tech goals: switching from a tank \u2192 swerve drive train Non-tech: reach more people through outreach events How is your team expanding? Our team expands through various recruitment efforts. RoboLoco hosted a lunch information session for underclassmen interested in joining our team. This information session concluded in 4 preseason hands-on workshops to attend in order to join the team. We promoted our name through the ACL club fair where we interacted with many interested students. Recruitment Hosted 4 workshops for interested students Lunch information session Promoted at ACL club fair How do you work with other local teams? RoboLoCo works with local teams like the Rookie FRC Team, Thunderbolts #9235. We provide them resources such as CAD models and past workshop slides, share our mentors, and give them advice. To help more rookie teams, we created FIRST STEPS, a website to provide non-technical resources and advice. RoboLoco also coordinated and hosted two FLL Explore Expos, helping 40+ teams. Finally, we created RoboCast, a podcast to highlight the work of FIRST teams, where we invite FRC teams to come speak. Mentor Rookie Lightridge Team (Thunderbolts #9235). Give them resources (CAD Models, past workshop slides), share mentors, give them advice Invited them to Kickoff FIRST STEPS Site to provide non-technical resources to rookie teams (mentor lightridge) FLL Events Hosted FLL Explore Expos Helped over 40 teams since 2019 Volunteered at FLL Challenge tournaments Lego drives for FLL Teams. 500 lbs received and donated Robocast Highlights the work of many individuals and FIRST teams Invites FRC teams to come and talk What is the role of mentors in your team? The mentors who are in our team have an extended knowledge about the subteam which they work with. Our mentors assist and guide members on our team, but do not engage in the work themself. Mentors have experience with the subteam where they work Students plan and mentors are there to assist and guide the members of our team What is your mission statement? Our mission statement is that \u201cWe are more than a First team, we are a community\u201d. As the first established team in Loudoun County, we stand by this to spread first and STEM through our community. Describe the team\u2019s methods, with emphasis on the past 3 years, for spreading the FIRST message in ways that are effective, scalable, sustainable, and creative. How does your team measure results? RoboLoCo spreads FIRST\u2019s message by creating more access points into STEAM. Our podcast, Robocast, has reached 330 global listeners, sharing FIRST and STEAM experiences. By attending conferences like the Virginia STEM Advocacy Seminar and National Advocacy Conference, we assisted in the increase of funding by $100M through ESSA Title IV Part A and the CTE Credit Bill SB1277. Our results are measured through the sustainability of outreach: 3 years of Robocast, 9 years of NAC membership, including 6 years on the advisory council. What\u2019s one thing you wish everybody knew about FIRST? FIRST brings STEM-lovers together, creating a community where everyone feels included and respected. One thing we with everyone knew about first is that it is not just a robotics competition but an organization that brings together like minded STEM lovers, creating a diverse community where everybody feels included and respected. Describe your team\u2019s demographics (male/female, racial) One thing our team takes pride in is our inclusivity. We have a 36% female membership, 45% female leadership, gender queer members, and a _ % colored population. 36% Female 45% Female Leadership Including LGBTQIA++ identifying members Do you trust the underclassmen to maintain the team next year? Yes, we train the underclassmen through workshops and our project lead system to take over the operations of the team. What does your team do to encourage volunteering? Volunteering is promoted in our team Slack, along with our coaches greatly encouraging it throughout meetings. Additionally, we feel the peer influence since many members, our friends, also go to the outreach events. Post it in Slack Tell people during team time Leads encourage it How do you fundraise all this? Our team receives monetary support from our sponsors and grants. Additionally, our team hosts various fundraising events, such as our recent Krispy Kreme fundraiser which brought in over $4,000 [e] revenue and $2000 profit. We also do the Roy Rogers Fundraiser\u2026 We get funding from sponsors Members pay the dues Fundraising at the Academies (Krispy Kreme) Grants If you had to pick only one thing to continue, what would it be? (each presenter can answer something different) Subteams Outreach Project lead system What results have you seen from your resources? [f] In our recent preseason competition, Bunny Bots, our team created a fully functioning competition robot in 30 hours using the resources provided at the ACL makerspace. From our great resources at the ACL Makerspace, we have seen results in building our bunny bots non-competition robot, building it in 30 hours. You guys do so much, your team is so big. How do you prioritize things? Each of our 4 subteams have one to two subteam leads that manage members and assign work. They decide what work is a bigger priority and the amount of people needed on each task. Leads often have years of experience in the team, and are nominated by previous leads, guaranteeing that new leads are prepared to guide the sub team. If you could pick one thing that is most impactful what would it be? Our most impactful thing that we have done as a team was made a robotics themed children's book, featuring our mascot, to teach kids about meaningful life lessons. We read this book to children in our community at local libraries. This season, we made a book with the moral of not judging people on the outside, integrating Gerald the Lemon and robots into the story. We created a picture book that features our team mascot, Gerald, and teaches readers about concepts of engineering and STEM in general We read this to children across our community in libraries where we hosted book readings How do you measure your impact on the community? We measure our impact on our local and global community by measuring the amount of people attending and interacting with our outreach programs. Volume of people attending and interacting with our outreach events. How do you excite your minority community? RoboLoco excites our minority community by hosting events that highlight STEM thinking and projects. In December 2023, we partnered with NSBE Jr. to host a robot petting zoo event at the ACL. In this event students built their own animals with a moving mechanical component- such as a tail moving. We\u2019ve also written and read our book, Gerald and His Robot, in Spanish to include another audience. Lastly, we have visited all the Title I Elementary Schools in LCPS and hosted various STEM events. We host events with NSBE Jr. In December 2023, we hosted a robot petting zoo event, consisting of kids making their own animals with a mechanical twist - such as opening the animal\u2019s mouth or wiggling their ears.

[Gerald hiding behind board, comes out] Gerald: Hi, I\u2019m Gerald the Safety Lemon, RoboLoCo\u2019s mascot! At RoboLoCo, we have 69 members and 5 subteams: mechanical, software, business, creative, and executive. Our mission is to develop future STEAM leaders and promote inclusion in our community. Detective 2: How did they promote leadership in STEAM? [open case file and look at it] Detective 1: Based on the evidence, it looks like they just implemented a new project-lead system that allows members to manage projects in their own subteams, developing their leadership in the process. Detective 2: It seems like new members also learned technical and non-technical skills at these preseason workshops. [a] Detective 1: Looks like he\u2019s not here, let\u2019s check the recording studio. [points at recording studio photo] Gerald: Here I was recording a new episode for our podcast, Robocast. In 2021, we launched Robocast, where we interview STEM professionals and fellow FIRST teams. Detective 2: No way, I love that podcast. I\u2019ve listened to all three seasons! Detective 1: Where can I listen to it? Detective 2: It\u2019s on Spotify, Google Podcasts, Apple Podcasts, and even YouTube. They focus on increasing awareness of STEM equity gaps and showcasing unique STEM perspectives! Detective 1: No trace of him here either, now to the Capitol Building! [points at Capitol building photo] Gerald: I was at the National Advocacy Conference, or NAC, petitioning for STEM legislation. RoboLoCo has been a part of the NAC Advisory Council since 2018, advocating for increased funding towards after-school STEM activities under ESSA Title IV Part A. Through this, we built relationships with Representative Jennifer Wexton, Senator Mark Warner, and former Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos! [open case file and scan it] Detective 1: According to the case file, they were able to advocate for STEM equity in underrepresented communities, contributing to over $100M in STEM funding. Detective 2: It also says that RoboLoCo helped organize the Virginia STEM Advocacy Seminar, where they talked to over 140 Virginia legislators to advocate for a variety of STEAM bills with the mission of incorporate robotics into curriculum and generate awareness for robotics. Detective 1: Sounds like Gerald, always working to spread STEM [ponder]. Wait, let\u2019s check Lightridge High School, since RoboLoCo helps the FRC team there! [points at Lightridge HS photo] Gerald: I was at Lightridge mentoring the Thunderbolts, the 2 nd active FRC team in Loudoun County. RoboLoCo provided them with award advice, resources like CAD models, our experienced mentors, and even invited them to our kickoff! We also volunteered at FLL competitions, started two Explore teams, planned two Explore Festivals, and hosted an FLL Challenge Regional! In all, we reached over 40 FLL teams. Detective 2: I heard that they help rookie FRC teams, like the Thunderbolts, which is why they created FIRST Steps. They noticed the lack of non-technical resources accessible to FRC teams, so FIRST STEPS serves as a collaborative online resource bank with business, creative, and safety materials targeted towards rookie teams. Detective 1: Aren\u2019t they competing against other teams though? Detective 2: Yeahhhhh, but FIRST is a collaborative community, and they want to promote Gracious Professionalism, which is why RoboLoCo also introduced \u201cRookie Reflections,\u201d allowing rookie teams to share their experiences. Detective 1: I was looking for Gerald in all the classrooms but oh!\u2026classrooms! Let\u2019s go to our next location, the Inspire Loudoun Conference! [points at classroom photo] Gerald: At this event, I was able to talk to LCPS teachers, highlighting the importance of robotics in the school system and showcasing RoboLoCo as an example. [b] Detective 2: According to testimonials, teachers were able to gather key information about RoboLoCo and develop lesson plans specifically for starting FTC and FRC teams at their schools! Detective 1: Since Gerald seems to love education so much, maybe he went to the library\u2026? [points at library photo] Gerald: RoboLoCo published a picture book titled, Gerald and His Robot, which introduced over 800 underserved preschoolers to robotics and teamwork in a fun and creative way! We also translated the book into Spanish to increase accessibility, and reached a wide audience by partnering with Loudoun Literacy Council, Head Start, and STEP to host 8 book parties. Detective 2: Why did they make a picture book, aren\u2019t they a robotics team? Detective 1: I know why! RoboLoCo wants to emphasize the artistic aspects of STEAM and focus on inspiring future generations to pursue their passions. Detective 2: Still no trace of him\u2026where was he next? Detective 1: Let\u2019s go back to the Academies of Loudoun, where RoboLoCo hosted a robotic petting zoo and an Hour of Code event. [points at ACL photo] Gerald: We hosted an event with the National Society of Black Engineers Junior to teach children the basics of robotics with Finch Robots and Hummingbird Bit kits. The art aspect of STEAM was incorporated by decorating the robots to look like the animals they were mimicking. [c] Also, we organized an Hour of Code event with the Academies of Loudoun Computer Science Honor Society, reaching 800 kids in the last three years. Detective 1: Why would they do all this? Detective 2: It\u2019s likely that they want to foster innovation and creativity and make engineering more accessible. Detective 1: Not here either\u2026let's check out the last place Gerald was seen, the Stone Springs Hospital. [points at StoneSprings hospital photo] Gerald: At Stone Springs Hospital, RoboLoCo showcased our robot and shared STEM knowledge with parents, students, and professionals. Detective 1: It seems that they were trying to reach a new demographic, spreading STEAM to even more people. Detective 2: Ugh, looks like it's almost time for the concert.\u2026 we should just head back. [closes curtains on board] [Gerald walks in front of board] Gerald: Hey! What are you doing with my baton? Detective 1: Um\u2026[hides batons behind back] nothing\u2026. Where were you? Gerald: I was busy inspiring the future generations of STEAM. Let\u2019s get back to the concert and create a masterful symphony for our community (Gerald), state (Detective 1), nation (Detective 2), and world (all). All: It\u2019s showtime!!!!!

Doesn\u2019t drive straight You should probably tune your PID values What if my PID values seem to have zero effect on robot drift? Robot Drift Caused Without PID? \u00b6 5/11/2024 Had a weekend meeting today and spent a good 4 hours trying to figure out a simple question: why is the robot not driving straight? At first, we believed it was PID values. We adjusted the Proportional term in turning PID to a value of 1, which hypothetically, should mean the robot should zigzag around the desired angle, as it violently oscillates around the setpoint. We tried this today, to zero effect, the behavior was the exact same as before. A bit later, we identified the issue that we believe was causing this, which is that rotational PID sets its setpoint to what it is currently at. Essentially, the input will take in a xspeed, y speed, and rotation. It converts these to be speeds to be delivered to the robot, a translation and rotation speed. When the turning motors of the robot don\u2019t have to move to satisfy this, the PID sets the setpoint to be the current position. This means that if the wheels have drifted, the PID doesn\u2019t prevent this, but reinforces it, allowing the drift to continue. We operated under this theory for the entire meeting today, and tried a bunch of different things to address it: If the user is not rotating the robot, set the setpoint for turning to the last setpoint \u00b6 The idea behind this was that by setting the rotational setpoint to what it was previously every time .drive() was called, it would fix our issue, as long as the user hasn\u2019t rotated the robot since then. Didn\u2019t work because the wheels can rotate without one explicitly using the rotation stick. (If you\u2019re facing forward and try to go 90 deg right, the wheels need to rotate, and this doesn\u2019t account for that). In retrospect yes this was a silly idea. Randomly set the rotation setpoint to -100 or 100, so the average is zero. \u00b6 What the frick was the point of this idea? How did we greenlight this? It made sense at the time, I promise (Rohit).

Try to use holes, not lengths Requires less machining precision Documentation!! Update subteam documentation Create a document with current/past issues, ideas for resolution, future plans Take notes on even small things that could become a problem Leave room for potential add-ons, think about what could go wrong ahead of time so it wouldn\u2019t need to be fixed during competition When organizing/packing for competition, make sure to think about how to access parts, as it would be helpful to have everything in an accessible place, yet also easily stored for travel Think about helpful sensors ahead of time, would give much more possibilities for software Bumpers!

Avoid overcomplicating machining due to too many parts Took too long this year Look into forces and where they will go Oversight caused intake to break, which was a major setback Check in on subsystems for wear beyond just the initial put together/test Would allow us to catch things like the intake rollers being rubbed against More modularity Require less attachment points to replace a part, would make repairs and additions much easier Reinforce extrusion Especially as robots move faster, make sure to use crush blocks and thicker extrusion where possible and required Avoid having 3D prints take too much impact Should not be parts that we need to replace often, 3D printing is typically used for stranger shapes or non-load/force bearing applications Subteam Organization Project leads?

Frames are drawn in Photoshop, and then animated in Adobe Animate, final assembly of animation in Premiere Pro. Steps: Write Script, Storyboard, Voice Lines, Draw Frames, Animate, Piece together Digital 30s animation, relevant to the current challenge. It can be in various mediums, including 2D, 3D, mixed media, stop motion, anything that can animate a story. The animation should reflect core values. Made in Blender and Premiere Pro Steps: Brainstorm core values and relation to theme, general draft of what to do, storyboard, animate assets in Blender, animate individual scenes in Blender, combined scenes in Premiere Pro Robot **Was not completed Was difficult to animate as lag would make it impossible to make fine adjustments or view the animation - 3DsMax was not cooperative in doing so Suggest trying Blender for the animation next year Animation highlighting what our competition robot does (i.e. scoring points, moving, etc.) Intended to be displayed during competitions Posters Leadership Movie-style poster with all the leads on it. Poster theme and style elements determined by the year\u2019s theme. Drawn in Photoshop. Leads are drawn by direct tracing photos of them. Steps: Brainstorm, rough draft, photograph leads, position and place photos, line art, base colors, rendering and final lighting Community partners Vertical poster highlighting the logos of our various community partners. Typically includes mascots. Style, action, design of mascots following the year\u2019s theme. Team banner 8 ft x 2 ft banner when printed out, but the digital version should be scaled down in size so that the dimensions in pixels have 4 digits (ex: 8400 pixels x 2100 pixels). Includes ACL ROBOLOCO in a large Sans Serif font, the team number, the \u201cpure virgin unadulterated\u201d ACL logo, and 2 or more mascots. Main colors should be team colors (blue, teal, yellow, green). Should be visible from far away with not too much detail. Should be consistent with the theme/style of ACL\u2019s past works and have timeless qualities so it can be used in following years (ex: no using year-specific FRC themes). Process: Reference advertisement billboards, other FRC banners, etc. for layout and inspiration. Make many rough sketches (at least 5) initally and conference with Coach Stone frequently for advice. Handouts Buttons Drawing: The file dimensions should be 800x800 pixels. Use this button template for reference. All text, logos, and important aspects of the illustration should be within the innermost circle. The space between the outer and middle ring is the overlap Each button should have either the team name, number or both Multiple designs per year, gerald safety buttons printed every year Printing: Format the buttons designs to 2.6 by 2.6 in size, fill the page. each page will have a different design Print in color, with equal numbers of subteam buttons, and larger numbers of safety and year theme buttons Pressing: How to use the press Safety comics One page comic made in brochure format, highlighting a specific Stickers Stickers with the ACL RoboLoCo logo in both small and large sizes printed and cut as handouts each year Robot one-pagers Other Robot decals Impact video Outreach book [f] Programs: Adobe Photoshop Adobe Illustrator [g] * Adobe After Effects * Features: editing/tweening program, mouse/keyboard * Ntk: pivots, types of motion, timing, loops, frames * https://youtu.be/hb2bbfiNBXA?si=9JhNBDxMflDwYzIm * https://youtu.be/sqm6dRtCsfQ?si=kE1TKkmf_FkPxFDh * Adobe Premiere Pro * https://youtu.be/keoszhf4DZ8?si=-LFjpvdFdb3aILMu (Intro to Premiere Pro) * Features: powerful timeline-based video and audio editing, * Can be integrated with other Adobe programs such as After Effects and Photoshop * Adobe Lightroom * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EJZvZMda4c (Intro to Lightroom) * Features: * Homespace (importing, organizing), * Detail View (filters, healing, masks, edit), * Edit Mode (adjust saturation, exposure, balance) * Key notes: * Work with what the picture has to offer * Intuitive, each photo needs different edits * Play with the filters and auto edits but don\u2019t rely on them * Copy and paste edit settings for photos in similar lighting * Blender * 7-Day Introduction Blender Tutorial: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgO2ChD7acqH5S3fCO1GbAJC55NeVaCCp&si=QE6IkawHGvNYZb-Z * Use first two videos for basic creation skills, and use last video for basic animating skills * Basic features * Keyboard shortcuts for movements (sizing, moving, rotating) * Use different perspectives and axes for better and more concise creation * Manipulating pivot point + snapping + combining elements * Manipulating mesh (Edit mode): faces, edges, vertices * Animating: Speeds * Common Issues and Solutions * After rendering, nothing is in the view * Have two views open, one of the camera view, and one general, move camera till image comes in frame * Color does not show up when rendering * Go to material editor, add a new material, choose a color * Autodesk 3ds Max * Suggest not using it next year as the school-provided computers can not handle the application. It also only supports Windows which some people use other operating systems. Recommended to use Blender instead for projects. * The application had a tremendous amount of lag and would glitch out constantly. * When exporting CAD models into 3DSMax, we used .step files. This does not export movable joints so any moving pieces need to be exported separately and assembled in 3DSMax. * Common Issues and Solutions * The UI would disappear and to get it back would require a reset of the UI * The object would teleport out of view and couldn't be found * The animation speed was not consistent, so parts would move at different speeds, making it difficult to animate all the parts because movements and rotations were out of sync Business \u00b6 Preseason: Workshops Icebreakers (10 mins) Created lesson plans (brainstorming outreach ideas, pit simulation, etc.) NSBE Jr. (10/17, 11/18) Krispy Kreme Visit the Krispy Kreme website and determine what flavors are offered at the location chosen for the fundraiser Print out order forms for all members( Krispy Kreme Order Form ) Hand out order forms and give members a 2 week time period to sell donuts (November 16 th - November 29 th ) Hand in cash/check at meetings (business members will count money and Dr. T will distribute receipts) Create spreadsheet of all orders (example: Krispy Kreme By Name ) Have coaches place orders a minimum of 72 hours in advance \\(4,166 raised -> ~\\) 2000 profit Book parties (Cascades, Rust, Brambleton) Loudoun Literacy Council, Wolf Trap, and Head Start and Level Up Contact Emily Hanlin to schedule dates (check library availability) Plan activities for book parties (ex: Outreach Activities ) Hour of Code Level Up and Propel Reach out to CSHS at start of year to see when they are hosting Hour of Code Work with CSHS to determine how many volunteers are needed Create volunteer sign-up for RoboLoCo Build Season: VSAS [h] Reached out to Virginia House representatives and Senators at the VA capitol about securing support for possible STEM legislation that was soon to be on the floor (such as Senate Bill 27 and House Bill 615) Worked with Team 1086 Blue Cheese Robotics to plan a conference at Deep Run High School with a panel of speakers. Put together materials such as talking points, schedule, etc. for the event. Collaborated with Blue Cheese To connect with VA legislators at the VA Capitol through both scheduled meetings and drop in visits. Impact: SB5 STEM+C Competition Team Grant bill that we advocated for at VSAS passed both the House and Senate and is on its way to the Governor for signing. Lincoln Elementary Sugarland Impact Essay Read impact essay guidelines and look at old RoboLoCo essays and Hall of Fame Essays. Take two meetings to brainstorm impact essay ideas and themes. Get different perspectives from all members even those that likely won\u2019t be writing impact Broke up the essay into paragraphs and assigned small groups to work on each for the first draft. Put paragraphs together and started editing as a whole essay. Go through and comment on the entire essay, then resolve all comments. Make a new draft document, and continue the editing process until the essay is complete. Have coaches check in with the process/content of the essay. Send to coaches to send to administration for approval (At least two weeks before impact essay deadline). Submit the essay through the FIRST Awards portal. Impact Video [i] Impact Presentation Figure out how to display the presentation (skit, powerpoint, etc.) If powerpoint Determine most versatile and impactful outreach If skit Brainstorm theme of skit (have a team of 6 people work on this) Decide on final theme Pick characters in skit and determine props Start writing script and building props 1 \u00bd months before first competition (6 people) Impact team (3 people): start memorizing and practicing scripts Do full run-throughs the 3 days leading up to competitions (night before presentation too) Competition Season: Woodie Flowers [j] : WOODIE FLOWERS SUBMISSION Choose nominee and designate 2-4 members to begin drafting a Woodie Flowers Submission Provide ample time (1-2 weeks) for leads to review as well as the nominee to Could have been done quicker - did not need as many drafts as we did Roy Rogers: Roy Rogers Proposal form for fundraiser Fundraiser hosted at 450 East Market Street from 10:30am - 1:30pm to raise funds for traveling to Worlds by washing cars for free and accepting donations Could have used more volunteers, ~20 volunteers this year -> caused car build up and people leaving Needed more advertisement, many volunteers left to advertise on the side of the road Follow up with Roy Rogers because they had no clue we were coming even after multiple calls were sent to the correct location Should bring a hose of our own if we can, one of their hoses was extremely tangled Could\u2019ve used more soap and microfiber towels $1,243 raised / $1,800 Spring Season: FLL Expo Hosted an FLL explore MASTERPIECE showcase for 15 FLL teams for them to present their work to us and we had volunteers from RoboLoCo act as reviewers The purpose of this is to introduce FLL teams to what they should expect at FLL events and build confidence in the teams Participation medals were handed out to each team 4 groups of two reviewers with ~4 teams to interview each Each group of reviewers gives one of 6 awards to each they interview (one per team) Innovation Day Level Up and Propel Volunteers VEX Robotics Inspire Loudoun 4/20/2024: Proposal for Inspire Loudoun: 2024 Bringing FIRST Robotics to Your School What we did Robot demo was successful and many teachers, parents, and children were interested in interacting with the robot and learning more about how to implement STEM in their respective classroom or school Gave information about starting a FIRST team to teachers Made a new pamphlet - \u201cBringing FIRST To Your School\u201d Future Register on time, it cost us the amount of people that came to our presentation Executive \u00b6 Process for changes to team affairs Could be used to alter meeting times (i.e extensions or additional meetings)* Discuss possible dates with the subteam(s) that need it * Write up a time extension proposal (purpose, dates, attendees) Buying new equipment (large, something that we usually don\u2019t buy): pit redesign materials, etc.* Discuss with coaches to see if it is feasible and what their expectations are * Work with associated subteams to determine specifics of the project * Write up a proposal (purpose, equipment) Team safety during a competition Methods of tracking people (in process to find a good solution for it): physical or digital boardsPresentations of team expectations and safety before competitionsRoom Captain system (overnight competitions) Role of Executive Subteam during meeting time Take up the role as a \u201csupervisor\u201dMake sure people are being kind and safe in meeting spaceHelp specific people or subteams if they need advice or something from the executive subteam* Write up proposals, new BOMs, communications outside of the team, etc. Supporting team members Student to student communication about issues, new ideas, etc.Should be able to help students with social issues on the team and offer/provide solutions (whether that be handling the situation as a lead or involving coaches) Supporting subteam leaders Being open to new ideas and providing realistic opportunities/solutions/steps to reach goalsTake up tasks they are concerned with (internal affair wise) so they can focus on subteam workHandling paperwork and offering sanity checks to implement new ideas while operating in a tight organizationWorking with coaches/subteam leads to find middle ground Supporting Coaches and Mentors Collecting information from subteams, members and relaying to coaches in order to grow the team/improve the teamInviting conversations/meetings with coaches and mentors and/or other partiesOffering to take up some responsibilities off of coaches\u2019 shoulders (i.e. initial decision making, email drafting, etc.) Strategy \u00b6 Scouting Strategy Team Build Season Kickoff Heavily analyze the game manual, have groups of 3-5 members read through different sections and take notes. Returning members should be looking out for any regulations, rules, fouls, major/minor differences from previous year\u2019s competition. Different game pieces, levels, points awarded, phases of the game, ranking points Strategy lead will head team-wide strategy meeting Determine scoring strategy for competition (considerations: defense, cost-benefit analysis, handling game pieces, ranking points, terrain, drive team roles) Consider Week 0, comp 1, comp 2, DCMP/Worlds scoring goals, what would a successful progression look like? How will the game meta change throughout the season? What will become more/less important from early to later comps? Look at robot characteristics (ex. speed, power, agility, center of gravity), what qualities work BEST for this game? App Development 2023 Scouting App developed using Dart programming language, Google Flutter framework to be adapted into several operating systems Flutter only requires developers to code in one language, Dart. Then, the framework automatically converts Dart code into code for specific OSs, ex. Kotlin/XML for Android, C++ for Windows, etc. Processes (3 main parts) Data Input/Interface: Make the app as intuitive as possible, with the interface as easy to use for those barely familiar with the game. Make it as difficult as possible to use it wrong. Data Export: Export as csv, xlsx files for compilation. Collect on one USB to compile on strategy lead\u2019s computer Data Processing: Use Tableau and Excel sheets to compute statistics and metrics for every team Development Goals: Build Week 1: App Schematics, Sketches, Drawings complete Build Week 3: Basic App UI finished (Variables, Methods, Simple Styling) Build Week 4: Full App finished, take styling opinions from Creative. Start reaching out to other teams for scouting alliances. Build Week 6: App testing, debugging, troubleshooting complete, ready for deployment onto devices. Write up app download and use guide. Comp 0: Test app in competition environment through Kindles, Windows, Mac devices. Note all bugs, possible improvements, additions. What are some pit/match scouting elements that other teams use that we should implement? Comp 1: Have all changes implemented and released as a new download. Determine which stats are useful/not useful throughout the compilation and picklist process. Comp 2: Have the app cleaned up with unnecessary data entries removed. Ensure that all data being gathered is useful. DCMP/Worlds: Final, final, final version. Technical Subteams Drive Team Competition Before Gain a general understanding of the skill composition. How many Elite, Decent, Mid-range, Rookie, Chassis bot teams are there? Which teams are ones that we should look out for (ex. good auto, consistent scoring, excellent drive team). Based on the robots competing, determine what robot qualities/strategies would be most beneficial. ex. Will defensive play or consistent and fast scoring have a bigger impact? Make scouting schedules and send out the day before competition, exclude people who already have competition duties (drive team, impact, volunteer coordinators, etc.) Make sure people know the game rules (which can surprisingly be an actual concern) Assign tasks to strat team During Scouting: ensure that people are on time for their shift and that all matches are fully covered. Compile data every few hours to see any trends or to help the drive-team. Having specific scouting leads helps take some of the workload off the strategy lead for scouting. Compare scouting data with other teams (that are willing) to determine accuracy Pit scouting should be completed on first day of competition Auto: Document auto routines for every team, becomes useful for pre-match planning Drive Team: Have a strategy representative for every pre-match alliance meeting. Based on alliance teams and opposing teams, devise a strategy beforehand to propose to other alliance members. This includes auto routine, tele-op roles, ranking points, and endgame routines. Before every match, give the drive team information on necessary strategy changes, additions, or implementations. After every match, give a brief report on any possible improvements or strategy deviations for the next match. Picklists Networking Alliance Selection After Fall/Spring Season Drive Team \u00b6 Controller Testing: hardwaretester.com/gamepad Mentors \u00b6 Mentors are people from all backgrounds and disciplines who share their knowledge, whether it is technical or non-technical. They support the team with subject matter expertise on an as needed basis including assisting the team with topics such as programming questions, building skills, scholarships, business management, marketing, or fundraising. Mentors are also role models and advisers who helps foster Gracious Professionalism\u00ae and FIRST Core Values in our students. The safety of our team members including students, mentors, coaches and volunteers are of the utmost importance. ACL RoboLoCo Mentors understand and follow policies, rules, procedures and best practices as they apply to our team. ACL RoboLoCo is governed by Loudoun County Public Schools (LCPS) policies, Academies of Loudoun (ACL) rules and practices, For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology (FIRST\u00ae) regulations and the ACL RoboLoCo team practices as outlined in this operating manual and as communicated by coaches. Mentors meet with the team during regular scheduled meetings. ALL meetings are supervised by ACL RoboLoCo coaches both in-person and virtual. Virtual Meetings are via Google Meets that are started and supervised by an ACL RoboLoCo coach. Electronic communications between mentors and students are through messages on Slack channels (no direct messages), emails that CC coaches and use student LCPS email address and team Remind for text messages. All Mentors must check-in using the LCPS Raptor system annually or as directed. Mentors show subject matter expertise by providing a resume or LinkedIn profile for review. All mentors are requested to complete the FIRST Youth Protection Policy Requirements. FIRST Youth Protection Policy is required to serve as a team chaperone. Mentors are adults working with minors. Mentors may NOT meet separately with team members outside of regular supervised meetings and events. This includes in-person or virtual meetings. Mentors may NOT communicate privately with team members via email, direct messages, text messages and other forms of electronic communication. Mentors must report any concerns about the safety and well being of team members to coaches immediately. Coaches are trained, mandatory reporters and have a duty to report.

It depends on what you want out the bumpers, but general we like to use hollow core. [e] The solid core noodles we used were also much harder to work with. As they were a bit larger than the half the height of the plywood, we had to compress it in order to stay within upper and lower height limits of bumper (this might not be the case with all solid core noodles, just an observation from the noodles we worked with this season).

Try to use holes, not lengths Requires less machining precision Documentation!! Update subteam documentation Create a document with current/past issues, ideas for resolution, future plans Take notes on even small things that could become a problem Leave room for potential add-ons, think about what could go wrong ahead of time so it wouldn\u2019t need to be fixed during competition When organizing/packing for competition, make sure to think about how to access parts, as it would be helpful to have everything in an accessible place, yet also easily stored for travel Think about helpful sensors ahead of time, would give much more possibilities for software Bumpers!

Avoid overcomplicating machining due to too many parts Took too long this year Look into forces and where they will go Oversight caused intake to break, which was a major setback Check in on subsystems for wear beyond just the initial put together/test Would allow us to catch things like the intake rollers being rubbed against More modularity Require less attachment points to replace a part, would make repairs and additions much easier Reinforce extrusion Especially as robots move faster, make sure to use crush blocks and thicker extrusion where possible and required Avoid having 3D prints take too much impact Should not be parts that we need to replace often, 3D printing is typically used for stranger shapes or non-load/force bearing applications Subteam Organization Project leads?

Returning members should be looking out for any regulations, rules, fouls, major/minor differences from previous year\u2019s competition. Different game pieces, levels, points awarded, phases of the game, ranking points Strategy lead will head team-wide strategy meeting Determine scoring strategy for competition (considerations: defense, cost-benefit analysis, handling game pieces, ranking points, terrain, drive team roles) Consider Week 0, comp 1, comp 2, DCMP/Worlds scoring goals, what would a successful progression look like? How will the game meta change throughout the season? What will become more/less important from early to later comps? Look at robot characteristics (ex. speed, power, agility, center of gravity), what qualities work BEST for this game? App Development 2023 Scouting App developed using Dart programming language, Google Flutter framework to be adapted into several operating systems Flutter only requires developers to code in one language, Dart. Then, the framework automatically converts Dart code into code for specific OSs, ex. Kotlin/XML for Android, C++ for Windows, etc. Processes (3 main parts) Data Input/Interface: Make the app as intuitive as possible, with the interface as easy to use for those barely familiar with the game. Make it as difficult as possible to use it wrong. Data Export: Export as csv, xlsx files for compilation. Collect on one USB to compile on strategy lead\u2019s computer Data Processing: Use Tableau and Excel sheets to compute statistics and metrics for every team Development Goals: Build Week 1: App Schematics, Sketches, Drawings complete Build Week 3: Basic App UI finished (Variables, Methods, Simple Styling) Build Week 4: Full App finished, take styling opinions from Creative. Start reaching out to other teams for scouting alliances. Build Week 6: App testing, debugging, troubleshooting complete, ready for deployment onto devices. Write up app download and use guide. Comp 0: Test app in competition environment through Kindles, Windows, Mac devices. Note all bugs, possible improvements, additions. What are some pit/match scouting elements that other teams use that we should implement? Comp 1: Have all changes implemented and released as a new download. Determine which stats are useful/not useful throughout the compilation and picklist process. Comp 2: Have the app cleaned up with unnecessary data entries removed. Ensure that all data being gathered is useful. DCMP/Worlds: Final, final, final version. Technical Subteams Drive Team Competition Before Gain a general understanding of the skill composition. How many Elite, Decent, Mid-range, Rookie, Chassis bot teams are there? Which teams are ones that we should look out for (ex. good auto, consistent scoring, excellent drive team). Based on the robots competing, determine what robot qualities/strategies would be most beneficial. ex. Will defensive play or consistent and fast scoring have a bigger impact? Make scouting schedules and send out the day before competition, exclude people who already have competition duties (drive team, impact, volunteer coordinators, etc.) Make sure people know the game rules (which can surprisingly be an actual concern) Assign tasks to strat team During Scouting: ensure that people are on time for their shift and that all matches are fully covered. Compile data every few hours to see any trends or to help the drive-team. Having specific scouting leads helps take some of the workload off the strategy lead for scouting. Compare scouting data with other teams (that are willing) to determine accuracy Pit scouting should be completed on first day of competition Auto: Document auto routines for every team, becomes useful for pre-match planning Drive Team: Have a strategy representative for every pre-match alliance meeting. Based on alliance teams and opposing teams, devise a strategy beforehand to propose to other alliance members. This includes auto routine, tele-op roles, ranking points, and endgame routines. Before every match, give the drive team information on necessary strategy changes, additions, or implementations. After every match, give a brief report on any possible improvements or strategy deviations for the next match.

It depends on what you want out the bumpers, but general we like to use hollow core. [e] The solid core noodles we used were also much harder to work with. As they were a bit larger than the half the height of the plywood, we had to compress it in order to stay within upper and lower height limits of bumper (this might not be the case with all solid core noodles, just an observation from the noodles we worked with this season).

Following the steps of the design process, they design computer programs and test them by programming a simulated robot vacuum cleaner (a LEGO robot) to move in designated patterns. Successful programs meet all the design requirements.\u201d https://www.teachengineering.org/activities/view/wpi_empathy_activity4 Try to finalize this overarching project and all the details surrounding it by the midpoint of the Saturday meeting and add the details to cost/logistics spreadsheets as well as the schedule above Small Activities: Should be no more than 45 minutes and should be simplistic, encouraging engineering, robotics, and guiding students on a path to the FRC community and robotics as a whole! Binary Bracelets (\u2248 1 Hour) Introduce binary numbers on a brief slideshow (5 minutes max) and proceed to the activity ( https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1x2oKOuxlqAbPApCsIxuaZ-PybcTSrc7ZRmFU75Hiq6I/edit?usp=sharing ) \u2192 Simplify wording to suit our target audience https://chandra.harvard.edu/resources/handouts/lithos/binary_bracelets.pdf Robot Driving (45 minutes on Tuesday) A fun intro activity for kids to get inspired by robots, and what amazing things they can do. Paper Airplane (45 min): Paper Airplane Pitching - Teaching Engineering and Entrepreneurship Paper airplane engineering challenge. The plane should be designed to carry the weight of 1 dollar in coins. This activity will be a group competition which will be reflected in the spreadsheet as 15 groups of 4 (assumed 60 participants on costs/logistics spreadsheet). Will retrieve all quarters from competitors after competition is over. Paper Coins Rubber bands Paper clips Tape Twister + Spinner Coding (45 mins) - I feel like Scratch is overused but that is dependant on the group, I personally think that the Rubber Band Powered Helicopters will be easier to do and will offer a more engineering and robotics approach to the summer camp! Plus I think pseudocode will offer a better way to represent the coding aspect of the camp. An activity which first lets kids build a spinner on a spinner like Scratch. Later, they break into groups and play using the spinners they made. Materials: Twister OR we can make our own \u201cgame board\u201d to save money (10 games would be $150) Laptop + scratch Tutorial: https://youtu.be/LyNqQkzzL34 1 volunteer per group \u2192 10 volunteers Rubber Band Powered Helicopters (45-60 mins) \u2192 Alternate activity Going through the engineering process to make a helicopter which runs on rubber band power. Materials: Popsicle sticks Rubber bands Paper Tape (5in per person) Propellers (40 for $18) Scissors Tutorial: https://youtu.be/DiJIvoHvGk4 1 volunteer for 5-6 kids \u2192 10 volunteers Cost and Logistics Spreadsheet: (Make sure that you are updating as you go for the cost and logistics) This sheet is extremely important when determining the price we charge, how feasible it is to make summer camp happen, and where we can get our materials \u2192 when finalizing activities make sure you include a link to buying the materials, try to find links where you can change the quantity of the products because we are not aware of the amount of materials needed yet. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U76CIPz-wvienG8Dy0yOQfjrT5nCLDuXcFx2Xsn_OzA/edit?usp=sharing \u2013 This spreadsheet assumes a estimated total # of participants as 60 and with the assumption that SPIKE kits are provided Intention of using ACL makerspace materials (like paper, scissors, and tape) for certain activities so these resources are not included on the costs lists. If makerspace cannot support the quantity of resources, members will help provide the resources such as paper or tape to support the camp! Note: many items are sold in bulk, so there may be an excess of materials which can be stored for future usage to use as materials for other camps or for donation drives to support other teams. Total revenue and profit are included assuming we charge 150 dollars per student.

Steps to Complete Before the Final Training Session: Visit the XRP website and make sure you understand the general layout and workings of the robot. You can enroll in this course for free and go through the modules. Ask KAVIN MURALIKRISHNAN or ANEESH SULE about any questions you may have regarding the robot! Look over this document and get familiar with it: XRP Volunteer Hacks . It is going to be updated constantly as we move closer to the training session, but this will serve as a one-stop-shop for troubleshooting during the camp.","title":"Volunteer General Info   Level Up Summer Camp"},{"location":"Summer%20Camp/XRP%20Documentation/","text":"General Info PestoLink driving If the robot version is < 1.21, update is necessary ( Link to download recent micropython versions). Hold down the BOOTSEL button (white with a label next to it), before plugging in the USB to the computer. This should turn it into USB mass storage device mode and it should provide a flash drive in file explorer. Download the version URF file from the link, and put it onto the top level of the flash drive. This should update the robot after some time/reset. Setup Info: Download repository from link which should contain two python files: pestolink.py, pestolink_example.py. BOTH FILES ARE NECESSARY. Upload pestolink_example to top level, pestolink.py to /lib/. Once you download the repository and upload them, make sure to press \u201crun\u201d in the top right corner of the screen. This will allow the robot to have bluetooth capabilities. Go to pestol.ink on a computer or mobile device. If on a computer, turn on the WASD keys setting (WASD runs more accurately than joystick/controller). Then, press connect and connect to the robot via bluetooth (the robot's name is XRPRobot). On a mobile device, the left joystick will drive the robot, and on the computer, the WASD keys will drive the robot. The buttons on the right will control the motors on the robot WPILib Java If one motor is faster, change the leftspeed or rightspeed as needed. They are located in DriveTrain.java line 61-63 To switch between tank drive and arcade drive, change setdefaultcommand (in robotcontainer) to whatever you need (getArcadeDriveCommand or getTankDriveCommand) XRP Editor App The XRP Editor app was customly modified by Kavin Muralikrishnan and Aneesh Sule to allow for Pesto Link support. Additions: Saving files works. The error was that the code referred to a file called state.json, which was in the .gitignore, meaning that it didn\u2019t get ported over to the base repository. state.json was a one line dictionary that just contained the directory in which xrp code would be stored. The fix was adding some code to create state.json if it didn\u2019t already exist Pesto Link support A new Controller section of blocks was added with values for Line Follower Code Note: Hardware issues. Turning 90 degrees turns it more like 85 or 95, and going straight still has drift.","title":"XRP Documentation"},{"location":"Summer%20Camp/XRP%20Volunteer%20Hacks/","text":"How to Access XRP on the Makerspace Laptops: On the taskbar of each MakerSpace laptop, there is an icon for both the XRP code editor and the pestolink for tele-op of the robots.
