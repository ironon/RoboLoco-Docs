<p>Script:</p>
<p>Detective 1: I’m so nervous about this concert. Hold on…where’s Gerald??</p>
<p>Detective 2: [looks in front of board] Oh no! Gerald is missing! Who’s going to conduct our orchestra?</p>
<p>Detective 1: We have to find him quickly!!! </p>
<p>Detective 2: Let’s hire some detectives!</p>
<p>[pulls on suit jackets and grabs conductor sticks, also opens evidence board]</p>
<p>Detective 1: We’re on the case! Now, where was he last seen??</p>
<p>Detective 2: Let’s retrace his steps!</p>
<p>[Detective 2 taps conductor baton at team picture]</p>
<p>Detective 1: He was first seen at the Academies of Loudoun for RoboLoCo’s meeting at the start of this week. What was he doing there?</p>
<p>[Gerald hiding behind board, comes out]</p>
<p>Gerald: Hi, I’m Gerald the Safety Lemon, RoboLoCo’s mascot! At RoboLoCo, we have 69 members and 5 subteams: mechanical, software, business, creative, and executive. Our mission is to develop future STEAM leaders and promote inclusion in our community.</p>
<p>Detective 2: How did they promote leadership in STEAM?</p>
<p>[open case file and look at it]</p>
<p>Detective 1: Based on the evidence, it looks like they just implemented a new project-lead system that allows members to manage projects in their own subteams, developing their leadership in the process. </p>
<p>Detective 2: It seems like new members also learned technical and non-technical skills at these preseason workshops.<a href="#cmnt1">[a]</a></p>
<p>Detective 1: Looks like he’s not here, let’s check the recording studio.</p>
<p>[points at recording studio photo]</p>
<p>Gerald: Here I was recording a new episode for our podcast, Robocast. In 2021, we launched Robocast, where we interview STEM professionals and fellow FIRST teams.</p>
<p>Detective 2: No way, I love that podcast. I’ve listened to all three seasons!</p>
<p>Detective 1: Where can I listen to it?</p>
<p>Detective 2: It’s on Spotify, Google Podcasts, Apple Podcasts, and even YouTube. They focus on increasing awareness of STEM equity gaps and showcasing unique STEM perspectives!</p>
<p>Detective 1: No trace of him here either, now to the Capitol Building!</p>
<p>[points at Capitol building photo]</p>
<p>Gerald: I was at the National Advocacy Conference, or NAC, petitioning for STEM legislation. RoboLoCo has been a part of the NAC Advisory Council since 2018, advocating for increased funding towards after-school STEM activities under ESSA Title IV Part A. Through this, we built relationships with Representative Jennifer Wexton, Senator Mark Warner, and former Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos! </p>
<p>[open case file and scan it] </p>
<p>Detective 1: According to the case file, they were able to advocate for STEM equity in underrepresented communities, contributing to over $100M in STEM funding.</p>
<p>Detective 2: It also says that RoboLoCo helped organize the Virginia STEM Advocacy Seminar, where they talked to over 140 Virginia legislators to advocate for a variety of STEAM bills with the mission of incorporate robotics into curriculum and generate awareness for robotics. </p>
<p>Detective 1: Sounds like Gerald, always working to spread STEM [ponder]. Wait, let’s check Lightridge High School, since RoboLoCo helps the FRC team there!</p>
<p>[points at Lightridge HS photo]</p>
<p>Gerald: I was at Lightridge mentoring the Thunderbolts, the 2<sup>nd</sup> active FRC team in Loudoun County. RoboLoCo provided them with award advice, resources like CAD models, our experienced mentors, and even invited them to our kickoff! We also volunteered at FLL competitions, started two Explore teams, planned two Explore Festivals, and hosted an FLL Challenge Regional! In all, we reached over 40 FLL teams. </p>
<p>Detective 2:  I heard that they help rookie FRC teams, like the Thunderbolts, which is why they created FIRST Steps. They noticed the lack of non-technical resources accessible to FRC teams, so FIRST STEPS serves as a collaborative online resource bank with business, creative, and safety materials targeted towards rookie teams.</p>
<p>Detective 1: Aren’t they competing against other teams though? </p>
<p>Detective 2: Yeahhhhh, but FIRST is a collaborative community, and they want to promote Gracious Professionalism, which is why RoboLoCo also introduced “Rookie Reflections,” allowing rookie teams to share their experiences.</p>
<p>Detective 1: I was looking for Gerald in all the classrooms but oh!…classrooms! Let’s go to our next location, the Inspire Loudoun Conference!</p>
<p>[points at classroom photo]</p>
<p>Gerald: At this event, I was able to talk to LCPS teachers, highlighting the importance of robotics in the school system and showcasing RoboLoCo as an example.</p>
<p><a href="#cmnt2">[b]</a>Detective 2: According to testimonials, teachers were able to gather key information about RoboLoCo and develop lesson plans specifically for starting FTC and FRC teams at their schools!</p>
<p>Detective 1: Since Gerald seems to love education so much, maybe he went to the library…? </p>
<p>[points at library photo]</p>
<p>Gerald: RoboLoCo published a picture book titled, Gerald and His Robot, which introduced over 800 underserved preschoolers to robotics and teamwork in a fun and creative way! We also translated the book into Spanish to increase accessibility, and reached a wide audience by partnering with Loudoun Literacy Council, Head Start, and STEP to host 8 book parties.</p>
<p>Detective 2: Why did they make a picture book, aren’t they a robotics team?</p>
<p>Detective 1: I know why! RoboLoCo wants to emphasize the artistic aspects of STEAM and focus on inspiring future generations to pursue their passions.</p>
<p>Detective 2: Still no trace of him…where was he next?</p>
<p>Detective 1: Let’s go back to the Academies of Loudoun, where RoboLoCo hosted a robotic petting zoo and an Hour of Code event.</p>
<p>[points at ACL photo]</p>
<p>Gerald: We hosted an event with the National Society of Black Engineers Junior to teach children the basics of robotics with Finch Robots and Hummingbird Bit kits. The art aspect of STEAM was incorporated by decorating the robots to look like the animals they were mimicking.<a href="#cmnt3">[c]</a> Also, we organized an Hour of Code event with the Academies of Loudoun Computer Science Honor Society, reaching 800 kids in the last three years.</p>
<p>Detective 1: Why would they do all this?</p>
<p>Detective 2: It’s likely that they want to foster innovation and creativity and make engineering more accessible. </p>
<p>Detective 1: Not here either…let's check out the last place Gerald was seen, the Stone Springs Hospital.</p>
<p>[points at StoneSprings hospital photo]</p>
<p>Gerald: At Stone Springs Hospital, RoboLoCo showcased our robot and shared STEM knowledge with parents, students, and professionals.</p>
<p>Detective 1: It seems that they were trying to reach a new demographic, spreading STEAM to even more people.</p>
<p>Detective 2: Ugh, looks like it's almost time for the concert.… we should just head back.</p>
<p>[closes curtains on board] </p>
<p>[Gerald walks in front of board]</p>
<p>Gerald: Hey! What are you doing with my baton?</p>
<p>Detective 1: Um…[hides batons behind back] nothing…. Where were you?</p>
<p>Gerald: I was busy inspiring the future generations of STEAM. Let’s get back to the concert and create a masterful symphony for our community (Gerald), state (Detective 1), nation (Detective 2), and world (all).</p>
<p>All: It’s showtime!!!!! (ALL)</p>
<p><a href="#cmnt_ref1">[a]</a>Fix</p>
<p><a href="#cmnt_ref2">[b]</a>possibly add another line</p>
<p><a href="#cmnt_ref3">[c]</a>change....</p></p>
