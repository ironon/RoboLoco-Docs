* About Your Nominee  
Tell us about your nominee's impact within FIRST and/or the STEM communities.

How has your nominee promoted STEM within their community?\*

Josh Aijima constantly seeks to create a positive impact in STEM within the community through his passion. He has been committed to promoting STEM in the younger generation since 1996, working as a Science teacher for many years. Later on in his STEM career, Josh won the US Department of Education's CTE Makeover Challenge and earned $50,000 for the Dominion High Makerspace; this was a remarkable achievement and his joy and enthusiasm for STEM only kept on growing. Similarly, he earned the VSTE Innovative Educator of the Year Award, which highlights those who display creativity, critical thinking, and a love for STEM. He then began to work at the Academies of Loudoun, a STEM magnet school, as the Makerspace Facilitator and Instructional Facilitator for Technology. Later, he was invited to RoboLoco, helping it run a multiplicity of STEM activities such as book parties, hours of codes, and much more. Josh wants to inspire the next generation of STEM students from a young age to bring experiences that they will remember and enjoy. 

How has your nominee promoted FIRST within their community?\*

Josh’s presence within the community has helped many students connect with FIRST. His work with RoboLoCo to conduct FLL Expos has allowed new and younger members of the FIRST community to gain experience and catalyze their FIRST journey. The previous year, Josh worked with Lightridge, a local high school that recently started its own FRC team (Team 9235 Thunderbolts), to help build a solid foundation for the team to build on in the future. Similarly, Josh works with the Loudoun County Computer Science Supervisor to bring FIRST to high schools and middle schools throughout the county. Though still in the early stages of this program, he wants to expand to connect with high schools and middle schools all across Loudoun County. Alongside the FIRST Chesapeake District Coordinator, Josh also aims to create a FIRST curriculum that can be taught at schools.

What else would you like us to know about your nominee?

Through his consistent efforts, Josh molds our FIRST team together by advocating for team-wide participation and spirit, which allows our members to collaborate effectively, on and off the field. Josh strengthens communication through his “Team Times", where all RoboLoCo members participate in activities designed to strengthen our community. Josh continually guides the team to collaborate and excel, and also greatly emphasizes safety. He conducts Green Orientation Badge lessons with the whole team to demonstrate proper Makerspace etiquette, machine operation, and emergency protocols. His carefully crafted travel binder details specific important information for each member, earning praise from the school admin, labeling him as “The Gold Standard for Trips.” His drive to challenge and support the team to the fullest extent has helped every team member reach their full potential.
