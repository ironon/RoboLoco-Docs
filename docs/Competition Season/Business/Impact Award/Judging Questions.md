Team Questions:

How is your team sustainable?

Our team has a specific leadership structure which includes subteam leaders to manage different parts of the team. These subteam leaders document progress on different projects and work. Additionally our team works on receiving grants and funding from organizations as well as our own fundraising events. With the use of hands-on workshops we train/recruit new members so they get the knowledge they need before joining the team itself. Lastly, our team constantly evolves to meet the needs of our community. For example, our team hosted a Lego Drive to collect lego donations to give to local FLL teams.[[a]](#cmnt1)

* Provide team with funding, physical resources (ACL Makerspace), mentors (Judith(BAE Systems))

What is your team’s greatest accomplishment? [[b]](#cmnt2)

Our team’s biggest accomplishment was the addition of our non-technical subteams: business and creative. It was so impactful to the team that in just 5 years, 2019 to 2024, it grew by more than 30 members. Currently, business still impacts the team by doing season essays and playing a big role in outreach events, like making books for book parties and planning hour of codes. Creative makes artistic season submissions, like the impact video, and makes team spirit, like shirts and buttons, that are used at outreach events and in the team.

* Establishment of our team’s nontechnical subteams from 2 members in 2019 to almost 35 in 2024
* Nontechnical subteams allowed us to have more outreach from business (ex. Book Parties, Hour of Code, FLL Competitions) as well as spirit (Shirts, buttons, pins)

If they ask for another accomplishment…

Our team's structure ensures that each and every member on the team feels welcome. We’ve almost doubled our team size in the past few years, and still, every member is able to participate. i’m

[[c]](#cmnt3)What makes your team unique?

There are numerous things that make our team unique. First of all, we host pre-season workshops for interested students to find which subteam suits them. In addition, our holistic nature connects technical and non-technical subteams together by organizing software outreach events, and custom bumpers. Finally, we create entry points to robotics through outreach and events.

* Our interdisciplinary approach allows students interested in joining our team to find a sub-team which fits their strengths. We do this by letting new members attend multiple technical and non-technical workshops during the preseason.
* Our holistic nature connects both technical and non technical subteams
* Business creating software-related outreach events
* Creative designing bumpers
* Creating more entry points into robotics through outreach and events

What obstacles have you overcome as a team?

The obstacles that we have overcome are that too many potential members were interested, so we had to limit the number we accepted. Before, we had difficulty planning outreach and promoting team spirit, so we created the business and creative subteams. Finally, new members were inexperienced during the competition season, so we created preseason projects for them to learn from.

* A high volume of potential members wanting to join the team, but not enough roles on our team to give everyone a spot
* 100+ new recruits each season
* Establishment of our sub-teams
* Preseason projects which assist with the team’s sustainability goal providing members with valuable hands on experience

Where do you see your team going in the future?[[d]](#cmnt4)

Our team strives to improve and constantly meet the needs of our community. Our nontechnical subteams have been working on reaching a larger audience through outreach events. 

* We plan to enhance our non tech and tech subteams.
* Tech goals: switching from a tank → swerve drive train
* Non-tech: reach more people through outreach events

How is your team expanding?

Our team expands through various recruitment efforts. RoboLoco hosted a lunch information session for underclassmen interested in joining our team. This information session concluded in 4 preseason hands-on workshops to attend in order to join the team. We promoted our name through the ACL club fair where we interacted with many interested students. 

* Recruitment
* Hosted 4 workshops for interested students
* Lunch information session
* Promoted at ACL club fair

How do you work with other local teams?

RoboLoCo works with local teams like the Rookie FRC Team, Thunderbolts #9235. We provide them resources such as CAD models and past workshop slides, share our mentors, and give them advice. To help more rookie teams, we created FIRST STEPS, a website to provide non-technical resources and advice. RoboLoco also coordinated and hosted two FLL Explore Expos, helping 40+ teams. Finally, we created RoboCast, a podcast to highlight the work of FIRST teams, where we invite FRC teams to come speak.

What is the role of mentors in your team?

The mentors who are in our team have an extended knowledge about the subteam which they work with. Our mentors assist and guide members on our team, but do not engage in the work themself.

* Mentors have experience with the subteam where they work
* Students plan and mentors are there to assist and guide the members of our team

What is your mission statement?

Our mission statement is that “We are more than a First team, we are a community”. As the first established team in Loudoun County, we stand by this to spread first and STEM through our community.

Describe the team’s methods, with emphasis on the past 3 years, for spreading the FIRST message in ways that are effective, scalable, sustainable, and creative. How does your team measure results?

        RoboLoCo spreads FIRST’s message by creating more access points into STEAM. Our podcast, Robocast, has reached 330 global listeners, sharing FIRST and STEAM experiences. By attending conferences like the Virginia STEM Advocacy Seminar and National Advocacy Conference, we assisted in the increase of funding by $100M through ESSA Title IV Part A and the CTE Credit Bill SB1277. Our results are measured through the sustainability of outreach: 3 years of Robocast, 9 years of NAC membership, including 6 years on the advisory council.

What’s one thing you wish everybody knew about FIRST?

* FIRST brings STEM-lovers together, creating a community where everyone feels included and respected.

One thing we with everyone knew about first is that it is not just a robotics competition but an organization that brings together like minded STEM lovers, creating a diverse community where everybody feels included and respected. 

Describe your team’s demographics (male/female, racial)

One thing our team takes pride in is our inclusivity. We have a 36% female membership, 45% female leadership, gender queer members, and a  \_ % colored population. 

* 36% Female
* 45% Female Leadership
* Including LGBTQIA++ identifying members

Do you trust the underclassmen to maintain the team next year?

* Yes, we train the underclassmen through workshops and our project lead system to take over the operations of the team.

What does your team do to encourage volunteering?

Volunteering is promoted in our team Slack, along with our coaches greatly encouraging it throughout meetings. Additionally, we feel the peer influence since many members, our friends, also go to the outreach events.

* Post it in Slack
* Tell people during team time
* Leads encourage it

How do you fundraise all this?

Our team receives monetary support from our sponsors and grants. Additionally, our team hosts various fundraising events, such as our recent Krispy Kreme fundraiser which brought in over $4,000[[e]](#cmnt5) revenue and $2000 profit. We also do the Roy Rogers Fundraiser…

* We get funding from sponsors
* Members pay the dues
* Fundraising at the Academies (Krispy Kreme)
* Grants

If you had to pick only one thing to continue, what would it be? (each presenter can answer something different)

* Subteams
* Outreach
* Project lead system

What results have you seen from your resources?[[f]](#cmnt6)

In our recent preseason competition, Bunny Bots, our team created a fully functioning competition robot in 30 hours using the resources provided at the ACL makerspace.

* From our great resources at the ACL Makerspace, we have seen results in building our bunny bots non-competition robot, building it in 30 hours.

You guys do so much, your team is so big. How do you prioritize things?

Each of our 4 subteams have one to two subteam leads that manage members and assign work. They decide what work is a bigger priority and the amount of people needed on each task. Leads often have years of experience in the team, and are nominated by previous leads, guaranteeing that new leads are prepared to guide the sub team.

 If you could pick one thing that is most impactful what would it be?

Our most impactful thing that we have done as a team was made a robotics themed children's book, featuring our mascot, to teach kids about meaningful life lessons. We read this book to children in our community at local libraries. This season, we made a book with the moral of not judging people on the outside, integrating Gerald the Lemon and robots into the story.

* We created a picture book that features our team mascot, Gerald, and teaches readers about concepts of engineering and STEM in general
* We read this to children across our community in libraries where we hosted book readings
* 

How do you measure your impact on the community?

We measure our impact on our local and global community by measuring the amount of people attending and interacting with our outreach programs.

* Volume of people attending and interacting with our outreach events.

How do you excite your minority community?

RoboLoco excites our minority community by hosting events that highlight STEM thinking and projects. In December 2023, we partnered with NSBE Jr. to host a robot petting zoo event at the ACL. In this event students built their own animals with a moving mechanical component- such as a tail moving. We’ve also written and read our book, Gerald and His Robot, in Spanish to include another audience. Lastly, we have visited all the Title I Elementary Schools in LCPS and hosted various STEM events. 

* We host events with NSBE Jr.
* In December 2023, we hosted a robot petting zoo event, consisting of kids making their own animals with a mechanical twist - such as opening the animal’s mouth or wiggling their ears.
* Title I Schools - Sterling ES, Forest Grove ES, Guilford ES, Rolling Ridge ES, Sugarland ES, Sully ES, Potomac ES, Meadowlane ES
* We volunteered at Sugarland Elementary Family Science Night
