Subject: Potential Sponsor - MITRE

Dear Coaches,

I hope you are doing well. One of our members, Jonathan Youmans, spoke with his mom, and she has asked for our sponsorship information/details (i.e. ACL RoboLoCo 2023-24 Sponsorship Packet).

The company in conversation is [MITRE](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.mitre.org/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1717314646623298&usg=AOvVaw25Q0BC3gIIKrnZzUOtqtFf), a not-for-profit organization based in McLean, VA. MITRE has partnered with several [Historically Black Colleges and Universities](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.mitre.org/news-insights/impact-story/hbcu-engineering-programs-use-mitre-attck-boost-cyber-defense-curriculum&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1717314646623705&usg=AOvVaw1vh8ljFwMaDL22gZgK5g4-) such as [Florida International University](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.mitre.org/news-insights/news-release/mitre-establishes-strategic-partnership-florida-international-university&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1717314646623925&usg=AOvVaw10AN6OzWLIPNmuXiFIbAZU) along with organizations such as [Advancing Minorities’ Interest in Engineering](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amiepartnerships.org/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1717314646624090&usg=AOvVaw2n_YQHvPV4O-ck6l5zf69w) in order to introduce STEM to underrepresented areas, which aligns with ACL RoboLoCo’s goal to promote diversity and inclusion in STEM.

A new sponsor would be extremely beneficial to our team for this upcoming year, as it shows growth in our team and provides us with monetary support. If we can acquire MITRE as a sponsor this year, then it is very likely that they will return in the coming seasons. 

Thank you so much, I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Kishan Srinivasan
