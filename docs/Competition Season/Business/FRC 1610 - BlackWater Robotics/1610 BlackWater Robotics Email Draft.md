Good morning FRC Team 1610 BlackWater Robotics,

This is FRC Team 5338 ACL RoboLoCo from the NoVA area. We interviewed some of your members at the FIRST Chesapeake District Championship in April and listened to some of the unique struggles that your team faced. We were intrigued by the challenges you faced and were wondering if you were interested in participating in our podcast, RoboCast. This podcast could act as a source of outreach for your team, a topic that was stressed multiple times. In the podcast, we would be asking questions about the struggles and successes the team has faced over time and what you have done to overcome these challenges. You can find some of our podcasts on [blogs](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blogs.lcps.org/robocast/robocast/robocastbyroboloco/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1717314634658054&usg=AOvVaw039Id_Lw0cxTJ7hlSAhVdc)Â and [Spotify](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://open.spotify.com/show/3w9WM9MftzM3mOY97xIlEo&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1717314634658440&usg=AOvVaw0GVGdPljDj2Mq45y-2F-wy). This podcast would last roughly one hour and the structure would be as follows: in the first 10-20 minutes, we would discuss the questions that would be asked and with the remaining 40 minutes (or however long it takes to answer questions) we would be asking the questions. With whatever time is remaining, we are open to questions and discuss future opportunities.

Best,

This is FRC Team 5338 ACL RoboLoCo from the NoVA area. We interviewed some of your members at the FIRST Chesapeake District Championship in April and listened to some of the unique struggles that your team faced. The issue that stood out the most was the lack of outreach you guys were able to do, as a result of having only 4 members + mentors. We also were told that you were only able to conduct outreach at county fairs as a result of
