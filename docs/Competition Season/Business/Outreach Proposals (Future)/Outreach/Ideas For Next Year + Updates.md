Certification for 

YEAR ROUND (DURING THE WHOLE YEAR):

* Marketing podcast on all platforms (Instagram, Facebook, Social Media)
* Marketing FIRST STEPS on all platforms and at outreach events (Instagram, Facebook, Social Media)
* Question sessions, from what I’ve heard technical and nontechnical, have had inadequate practicing sessions. That being said, one of the mentors came up to me and said “I think you guys get caught up in the idea of non technical and technical judges.” This puts a new perspective that I think we should try next year. We need to create a way that both technical and nontechnical can answer each other’s questions. A holistic approach is the ONLY way we can tackle this. I strongly believe that we should approach this as such.
