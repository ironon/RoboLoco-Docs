Hi Coaches,

I hope you are doing well. At Inspire Loudoun, Hillside Elementary School’s instructional facilitator for technology, Deborah Haynie, reached out to us saying she wanted us to demonstrate our robot to Hillside Elementary (43000 Ellzey Dr, Ashburn, VA 20148) on May 17th from 6:30-8:30pm for Hillside’s STEAM Fair. We would have to bring Rock’N’Rivets to this event for the demo, and it is 11 minutes away from the Academies. Aneesh and I have crafted a proposal for this possible outreach event. We would appreciate it if you could read it over and submit for approval. We also are requesting one coach to be a part of this outreach event. Please email us back if you have any questions, comments, or concerns about this event.

Thanks,

Srin Dasari and Aneesh Ghosal
