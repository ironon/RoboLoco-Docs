Camp Tag-A-Long Outreach Proposal



---

Description of Event w/ Purpose: 

RoboLoCo will be hosting an outreach event with the Girl Scouts, at the summer camp Camp-Tag-A-Long. There is an expected number of 250 kids ranging in age from 6 to 11 years old. Here we will be distributing roboloco pins, demonstrating the robot, and having the girl scouts do a human pseudocode maze. This will help deepen our footprint in Loudoun County and promote the ideas and concepts of First Robotics. We will be in the headquarters with air conditioning and lots of space. They will come in groups of 20-30. We will have stations that the scouts can go through. The event ranges from 8:30 am - 1:45 pm. In that time we will have 2 shifts of 7 -10 members who will be running and conducting the stations. This will help spread outreach in the community through volunteer organizations such as girl scouts. There will only be one group at a time and each group will be required to stay for 20 minutes. The STEM activities will not only expand First ideas but we hope that it can inspire a younger generation and support more women in STEM. Our team's portfolio for awards such as impact and engineering inspiration will also be enhanced.
