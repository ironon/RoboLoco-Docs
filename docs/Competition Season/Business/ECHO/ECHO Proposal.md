Description of Event w/ Purpose: 

FIRST Robotics Team 5338, ACL RoboLoCo plans to host an outreach event for ECHO. ECHO is a nonprofit located in Leesburg, VA that offers lifelong support for adults with disabilities. This event will allow ACL RoboLoCo to spread robotics and STEAM to an older special-needs audience who haven’t been given the opportunity to learn more about STEAM. The event will be held at the ECHO facility at 71 Lawson Rd SE, Leesburg, VA 20175. We will do two separate activities (candy gears and popsicle catapult), each about 30 minutes long, as well as a 15 minute robot demonstration. The candy gear activity will teach how small components created by individuals can be put together to create larger pieces of machinery. In addition, the popsicle catapult activity will teach participants how to iterate on designs in order to accomplish a task.
