* Marshmallow and straws structure (30 min)
* Children will be given a limited amount of straws and marshmallows to create certain shapes from the visuals given to them
* There will be differing levels of the shapes they will be asked to make
* 2D Triangle (Easy)
* 2D Square (Medium)
* Prism (Hard/Challenge)
* Materials needed:
* Slideshow explaining how to make shapes with marshmallows and the different shapes they will be asked to create
* Marshmallows
* Straws
* STEAM Representation
* Cup Stacking![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/wInLoqxfzCnbN3wndTMTv-vXoNFKpSYYWmV3imdXS7ew6Z3HVifSjW9HD4LHUduNMYAQvXoWmFvdv2_We-k_H-2Kd8MVIzp337tDv_KTmYKGthlquDh02c7TpniWV61s2k9kBbgDpodgxmwJX9ZOj8k)
* Children will be asked to stack different cups on top of each other to create different simple shapes, such as rectangles and pyramids
* Children will be asked to stack different cups on top of each other to create different simple shapes
* Prism (Easy)
* Rectangle (Medium)
* Triangle (Hard)
* Can be modified to make it even more challenging
* Cup stacking develops their hand-eye-coordination, critical and creative thinking, and concentration, as well as understanding key concepts of engineering. Additionally, children will learn the importance of having a strong foundation
* Materials Needed:
* Solo Cup Pyramids → 45 cups. 3 stations of cup stacking, 15 cups each station

* Marble Maze![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/n-EizZ0vJXw4d_5Ik7l3Jzi8a2yG83qQznAE2f7kDUiZjnPJSPPfx4WKqzPEkpO-kCDTskYPdjCCg-MGXmpK9jWTjagQOgi9KIvys35yjcGCzF0_PfGiQg8o3F-GsQfIVZGq5UOrylsnUC0iv6irJ0g)
* See Visual Above.
* Make three different “mazes” on plates using straws and glue
* The participants at the book party are asked to get the marble out of the maze.
* One easy maze, one medium maze, one hard maze.
* 2 Stations of marble maze
* Materials Required:
* 1 Pack of Straws
* 6 Marbles
* 6 plates
* STEAM Representation:
* Art on our side building the maze to challenge the preschoolers and participants at the book party and also challenging the participants to think critically while having to navigate the marble around the maze. STEAM requires critical thinking throughout all parts and we are encouraging it.

* Paper Robot Craft![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/dghpAKUS7Ig1cCAYZmPCqAVudMjtzSivegcsf_jFfK8QURtQ5_cWxmbGsd7phq-zOn-MC8ifS_yx3xcNzbU5E1EbCWrj84ihR-15IFhSm17bwb1-5_iADVpfG8s-6BMoJhSflZhpdujoS7k2nkMt0vU)

* Beforehand, roboloco members will create cutouts of colored paper of all different sizes and shapes
* Children will be asked to take the cutouts and create their own “ 2D Robot” using their own creativity
* Crayons will also be handed out for further customization
* Materials needed:
* Cutouts of colored paper
* Crayons (5 packs)
* STEAM Representation:
* Kids are using their skills to create works of art which also represents engineering, since engineering is a part of building a robot. They also use technology (tools used to make life easier) to create the paper robot. Also sparks their own creativity as they create a robot from their own imagination and personalize it.

* OPTIONAL ACTIVITY: RAPTOR RIVETS CHANT AT THE END OF THE BOOK PARTY FOR SPIRIT!
* No materials necessary, just spend time teaching kids a roboloco chant.
* Rapor rivets, roar roar roar roar roar.
* “When I say Robo, you say LoCo. Robo! LoCo! Robo! LoCo!”
* Preschoolers Pseudocode their Parents
* Kids pseudocode their parents to do simple tasks
* Pseudocode - Commands of very simple and small tasks (move forward one step, turn left/right, move hands forward, hold object, etc.)
* Tasks:
* Bring a cup to the kid
* Make a paper ball
* Bring the paper ball back to the kid
* Put it in the cup
* Preschooler Paper Airplane Challenge
* Roboloco members will create a slideshow to present to the children
* The slideshow will include:
* Very simple science of airplanes (sharp point slices through air, big wings are better than smaller wings, etc.)
* How to create a paper airplane
* Some ideas of paper airplanes they could make
* Kids will use printer paper to create their own dream airplane
* Materials:
* Printer paper
* Crayons (10 set count & can be reused)
* Markers (10 set count & can be reused)
* Tinfoil Boat

* Roboloco members will create a few tin foil boats to show kids
* Boats will include:
* Some shapes and structures that they can use - rectangle with large base, small base, triangles, etc.
* Children will then be asked to create their own boats using tinfoil in order to hold as much weight as possible
* They may create their own shapes and structures using their creativity and what they believe would hold the best weight
* RoboLoCo members will test their custom boats by measuring how much weight they can hold
* Weights used will be coins
* Materials:
* Tinfoil (One roll)
* Coins (10 pennies, 5 nickels, 5 quarters)
* Bucket (to be filled with water)
* Ideally a wide and short bucket
* Gerald coloring pages
* Materials: Coloring pages, crayons
* Break between activities one and two is the robot demo.
* Materials: Robot, ball, etc.
