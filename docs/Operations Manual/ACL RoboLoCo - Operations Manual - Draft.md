Team Structure…

Mechanical
==========

Ideal Timeframe (maybe reorganize to a week by week thing)

Build Season

Design

* 1st week:
* Brainstorming general ideas and structures
* Powerpoint CAD, CrayolaCAD, sketches and drawings
* Narrowing down to a specific design/archetype
* Deciding on game strategy
* Looking at potential complexity vs. advantages + disadvantages
* Beginning CAD model, deciding on chassis dimensions
* 2nd week:
* CAD
* Prototyping?
* Constructing chassis with correct dimensions so software can use it
* Electrical board layout
* Create initial BOM
* Put together machining spreadsheet
* Begin bumpers with chassis dimensions

Machining

* 3rd week:
* Lay out parts to be marked and cut
* Target parts that can be assembled together, subsystem by subsystem
* Finish up bumpers other than fabric?
* Spray painting
* 4th week:
* Finish up machining
* Spray painting

Assembly

* 3rd week:
* Put together parts as they are made, given that there is time and people
* 4th week:
* If parts arrive, put together motor gearboxes
* Continue assembly
* Finish bumpers
* 5th week:
* Finish up assembly
* Give software time to begin wiring

Competition Prep

* Make a list of spare parts and begin manufacturing them
* Organize what to bring for competition ahead of time, rather than the meeting before
* Tech binder during week 6
* Robot design explanations for judges to allow for pit rotationsons

Competition Season (might group into previous section as a post week 5)

Repairs

* Use a meeting to gather everything needed for a repair, then let software test (if it still moves/has things to test)

Add-Ons

* After turning over the robot, think about how to add things on without making too many changes
* Gather parts before hand, try to take little time

Best Practices (split up into cad, machining, assembly, misc.)

* Try to use holes, not lengths
* Requires less machining precision
* Documentation!!
* Update subteam documentation
* Create a document with current/past issues, ideas for resolution, future plans
* Take notes on even small things that could become a problem
* Leave room for potential add-ons, think about what could go wrong ahead of time so it wouldn’t need to be fixed during competition
* When organizing/packing for competition, make sure to think about how to access parts, as it would be helpful to have everything in an accessible place, yet also easily stored for travel
* Think about helpful sensors ahead of time, would give much more possibilities for software
* Bumpers!
* Always try to use hollow core pool noodles[[a]](#cmnt1)[[b]](#cmnt2)[[c]](#cmnt3)[[d]](#cmnt4)[[e]](#cmnt5)
* A vertical pool noodle piece in the corner can protect robot from corner impact
* 

Lessons from 2024 Season (maybe group?)

* Avoid overcomplicating machining due to too many parts
* Took too long this year
* Look into forces and where they will go
* Oversight caused intake to break, which was a major setback
* Check in on subsystems for wear beyond just the initial put together/test
* Would allow us to catch things like the intake rollers being rubbed against
* More modularity
* Require less attachment points to replace a part, would make repairs and additions much easier
* Reinforce extrusion
* Especially as robots move faster, make sure to use crush blocks and thicker extrusion where possible and required
* Avoid having 3D prints take too much impact
* Should not be parts that we need to replace often, 3D printing is typically used for stranger shapes or non-load/force bearing applications

Subteam Organization

* Project leads?
* Worked well for business, underutilized in mech
* More defined groups/tasks to avoid free floating members without tasks
* More outside of slack documents
* Helps keep track of things

Software

Projects:

* Animations
* Safety
* 30s animation following year’s theme in 2d illustrations. Frames are drawn in Photoshop, and then animated in Adobe Animate, final assembly of animation in Premiere Pro.
* Steps: Write Script, Storyboard, Voice Lines, Draw Frames, Animate, Piece together
* Digital
* 30s animation, relevant to the current challenge. It can be in various mediums, including 2D, 3D, mixed media, stop motion, anything that can animate a story. The animation should reflect core values.
* Made in Blender and Premiere Pro
* Steps: Brainstorm core values and relation to theme, general draft of what to do, storyboard, animate assets in Blender, animate individual scenes in Blender, combined scenes in Premiere Pro
* Robot
* \*\*Was not completed
* Was difficult to animate as lag would make it impossible to make fine adjustments or view the animation - 3DsMax was not cooperative in doing so
* Suggest trying Blender for the animation next year
* Animation highlighting what our competition robot does (i.e. scoring points, moving, etc.)
* Intended to be displayed during competitions

* Posters
* Leadership
* Movie-style poster with all the leads on it. Poster theme and style elements determined by the year’s theme.
* Drawn in Photoshop. Leads are drawn by direct tracing photos of them.
* Steps: Brainstorm, rough draft, photograph leads, position and place photos, line art, base colors, rendering and final lighting
* Community partners
* Vertical poster highlighting the logos of our various community partners. Typically includes mascots. Style, action, design of mascots following the year’s theme.
* Team banner
* 8 ft x 2 ft banner when printed out, but the digital version should be scaled down in size so that the dimensions in pixels have 4 digits (ex: 8400 pixels x 2100 pixels). Includes ACL ROBOLOCO in a large Sans Serif font, the team number, the “pure virgin unadulterated” ACL logo, and 2 or more mascots. Main colors should be team colors (blue, teal, yellow, green). Should be visible from far away with not too much detail. Should be consistent with the theme/style of ACL’s past works and have timeless qualities so it can be used in following years (ex: no using year-specific FRC themes).
* Process: Reference advertisement billboards, other FRC banners, etc. for layout and inspiration. Make many rough sketches (at least 5) initally and conference with Coach Stone frequently for advice.
* Handouts
* Buttons
* Drawing: The file dimensions should be 800x800 pixels. Use [this button template](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lpeeZt9my7Aky83lqeKTkMB-BOiEBFoS/view?usp%3Ddrive_link&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1717314618947173&usg=AOvVaw1_uUVSLy5LRHCO6l18kQFr) for reference.
* All text, logos, and important aspects of the illustration should be within the innermost circle. The space between the outer and middle ring is the overlap
* Each button should have either the team name, number or both
* Multiple designs per year, gerald safety buttons printed every year
* Printing:
* Format the buttons designs to 2.6 by 2.6 in size, fill the page.
* each page will have a different design
* Print in color, with equal numbers of subteam buttons, and larger numbers of safety and year theme buttons
* Pressing:
* [How to use the press](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DFytGK_R-RV8&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1717314618948365&usg=AOvVaw04vkAJuIlN8_vmavSs_Ntt)

* Use first two videos for basic creation skills, and use last video for basic animating skills
* Basic features
* Keyboard shortcuts for movements (sizing, moving, rotating)
* Use different perspectives and axes for better and more concise creation
* Manipulating pivot point + snapping + combining elements
* Manipulating mesh (Edit mode): faces, edges, vertices
* Animating: Speeds
* Common Issues and Solutions
* After rendering, nothing is in the view
* Have two views open, one of the camera view, and one general, move camera till image comes in frame
* Color does not show up when rendering
* Go to material editor, add a new material, choose a color
* Autodesk 3ds Max
* Suggest not using it next year as the school-provided computers can not handle the application. It also only supports Windows which some people use other operating systems. Recommended to use Blender instead for projects.
* The application had a tremendous amount of lag and would glitch out constantly.
* When exporting CAD models into 3DSMax, we used .step files. This does not export movable joints so any moving pieces need to be exported separately and assembled in 3DSMax.
* Common Issues and Solutions
* The UI would disappear and to get it back would require a reset of the UI
* The object would teleport out of view and couldn't be found
* The animation speed was not consistent, so parts would move at different speeds, making it difficult to animate all the parts because movements and rotations were out of sync

Executive
=========



| Process for changes to team affairs | Could be used to alter meeting times (i.e extensions or additional meetings)* Discuss possible dates with the subteam(s) that need it * Write up a time extension proposal (purpose, dates, attendees)  Buying new equipment (large, something that we usually don’t buy): pit redesign materials, etc.* Discuss with coaches to see if it is feasible and what their expectations are * Work with associated subteams to determine specifics of the project * Write up a proposal (purpose, equipment) |
| --- | --- |
| Team safety during a competition | Methods of tracking people (in process to find a good solution for it): physical or digital boardsPresentations of team expectations and safety before competitionsRoom Captain system (overnight competitions) |
| Role of Executive Subteam during meeting time | Take up the role as a “supervisor”Make sure people are being kind and safe in meeting spaceHelp specific people or subteams if they need advice or something from the executive subteam* Write up proposals, new BOMs, communications outside of the team, etc. |
| Supporting team members | Student to student communication about issues, new ideas, etc.Should be able to help students with social issues on the team and offer/provide solutions (whether that be handling the situation as a lead or involving coaches) |
| Supporting subteam leaders | Being open to new ideas and providing realistic opportunities/solutions/steps to reach goalsTake up tasks they are concerned with (internal affair wise) so they can focus on subteam workHandling paperwork and offering sanity checks to implement new ideas while operating in a tight organizationWorking with coaches/subteam leads to find middle ground |
| Supporting Coaches and Mentors | Collecting information from subteams, members and relaying to coaches in order to grow the team/improve the teamInviting conversations/meetings with coaches and mentors and/or other partiesOffering to take up some responsibilities off of coaches’ shoulders (i.e. initial decision making, email drafting, etc.) |

* Heavily analyze the game manual, have groups of 3-5 members read through different sections and take notes. Returning members should be looking out for any regulations, rules, fouls, major/minor differences from previous year’s competition.
* Different game pieces, levels, points awarded, phases of the game, ranking points
* Strategy lead will head team-wide strategy meeting
* Determine scoring strategy for competition (considerations: defense, cost-benefit analysis, handling game pieces, ranking points, terrain, drive team roles)
* Consider Week 0, comp 1, comp 2, DCMP/Worlds scoring goals, what would a successful progression look like?
* How will the game meta change throughout the season? What will become more/less important from early to later comps?
* Look at robot characteristics (ex. speed, power, agility, center of gravity), what qualities work BEST for this game?
* App Development
* 2023 Scouting App developed using Dart programming language, Google Flutter framework to be adapted into several operating systems
* Flutter only requires developers to code in one language, Dart. Then, the framework automatically converts Dart code into code for specific OSs, ex. Kotlin/XML for Android, C++ for Windows, etc.
* Processes (3 main parts)
* Data Input/Interface: Make the app as intuitive as possible, with the interface as easy to use for those barely familiar with the game. Make it as difficult as possible to use it wrong.
* Data Export: Export as csv, xlsx files for compilation. Collect on one USB to compile on strategy lead’s computer
* Data Processing: Use Tableau and Excel sheets to compute statistics and metrics for every team
* Development Goals:
* Build Week 1: App Schematics, Sketches, Drawings complete
* Build Week 3: Basic App UI finished (Variables, Methods, Simple Styling)
* Build Week 4: Full App finished, take styling opinions from Creative. Start reaching out to other teams for scouting alliances.
* Build Week 6: App testing, debugging, troubleshooting complete, ready for deployment onto devices. Write up app download and use guide.
* Comp 0: Test app in competition environment through Kindles, Windows, Mac devices. Note all bugs, possible improvements, additions. What are some pit/match scouting elements that other teams use that we should implement?
* Comp 1: Have all changes implemented and released as a new download. Determine which stats are useful/not useful throughout the compilation and picklist process.
* Comp 2: Have the app cleaned up with unnecessary data entries removed. Ensure that all data being gathered is useful.
* DCMP/Worlds: Final, final, final version.
* Technical Subteams
* Drive Team

Competition

* Before
* Gain a general understanding of the skill composition. How many Elite, Decent, Mid-range, Rookie, Chassis bot teams are there? Which teams are ones that we should look out for (ex. good auto, consistent scoring, excellent drive team).
* Based on the robots competing, determine what robot qualities/strategies would be most beneficial. ex. Will defensive play or consistent and fast scoring have a bigger impact?
* Make scouting schedules and send out the day before competition, exclude people who already have competition duties (drive team, impact, volunteer coordinators, etc.)
* Make sure people know the game rules (which can surprisingly be an actual concern)
* Assign tasks to strat team
* During
* Scouting: ensure that people are on time for their shift and that all matches are fully covered. Compile data every few hours to see any trends or to help the drive-team.
* Having specific scouting leads helps take some of the workload off the strategy lead for scouting.
* Compare scouting data with other teams (that are willing) to determine accuracy
* Pit scouting should be completed on first day of competition
* Auto: Document auto routines for every team, becomes useful for pre-match planning
* Drive Team: Have a strategy representative for every pre-match alliance meeting. Based on alliance teams and opposing teams, devise a strategy beforehand to propose to other alliance members. This includes auto routine, tele-op roles, ranking points, and endgame routines.
* Before every match, give the drive team information on necessary strategy changes, additions, or implementations.
* After every match, give a brief report on any possible improvements or strategy deviations for the next match.
* Picklists
* 
* Networking
* 
* Alliance Selection
* 
* After

JULY BREAK

[[a]](#cmnt_ref1)is there a reason for this? from what i've seen, a lot of teams are switching to solid core because it supposedly has better protection

[[b]](#cmnt_ref2)\_Marked as resolved\_

[[c]](#cmnt_ref3)\_Re-opened\_

[[d]](#cmnt_ref4)Solid core pool noodles are much harder than hollow core, so sometimes it will transfer much more energy into the robot than hollow core but provide more resistance to impact. It depends on what you want out the bumpers, but general we like to use hollow core.

[[e]](#cmnt_ref5)The solid core noodles we used were also much harder to work with. As they were a bit larger than the half the height of the plywood, we had to compress it in order to stay within upper and lower height limits of bumper (this might not be the case with all solid core noodles, just an observation from the noodles we worked with this season).
