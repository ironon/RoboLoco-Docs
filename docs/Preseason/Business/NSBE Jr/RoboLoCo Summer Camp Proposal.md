Overarching Project:   
Place ALL of your ideas here for overarching project ideas, make sure to be specific with all details such as cost, logistics, timings, difficulty levels, and other important details: 

Kick Start a Business Lesson Plan: Spike Kits - [https://education.lego.com/en-us/lessons/prime-kickstart-a-business/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://education.lego.com/en-us/lessons/prime-kickstart-a-business/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1717314697895879&usg=AOvVaw2dBTR3uiaguWJUm3lCntne)

In this unit, kids will develop effective problem-solving skills by decomposing problems into smaller parts. They'll use pseudocode as a tool for sequencing actions, use existing code with attributions in order to recognize patterns, systematically identify and fix bugs, and use conditions and compound conditions to program encoded devices.

Lesson 1: 

Back to Back (Beginner) - 45 min

[https://education.lego.com/en-us/lessons/prime-kickstart-a-business/back-to-back/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://education.lego.com/en-us/lessons/prime-kickstart-a-business/back-to-back/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1717314697896282&usg=AOvVaw1tY5tGxBrtDuWLGgliz2Oy)

In this lesson, students will build a LEGO model and write pseudocode that tells how to build the model.

Lesson 4:

Keep it Really Safe - 1 hour 45 min

[https://education.lego.com/en-us/lessons/prime-kickstart-a-business/keep-it-really-safe/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://education.lego.com/en-us/lessons/prime-kickstart-a-business/keep-it-really-safe/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1717314697898148&usg=AOvVaw0V4pRQgfmn1gmGjFBCGSo-)

Automated it! - 1 hour 45 min

[https://education.lego.com/en-us/lessons/prime-kickstart-a-business/automate-it/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://education.lego.com/en-us/lessons/prime-kickstart-a-business/automate-it/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1717314697898559&usg=AOvVaw3YCBpAV33YjaugU8vLBfSz) 

Final challenge for students where they are tasked to design a robot to solve a problem. Create and program an automated helper that can identify and ship the correct package based on color.

Objectives:

* Use computational thinking skills to produce a complete solution to a problem.
* Use creative thinking skills to design a solution to a problem.

Automatic Floor Cleaner Computer Program Challenge (Inspiration)

“Students learn more about assistive devices, specifically biomedical engineering applied to computer engineering concepts, with an engineering challenge to create an automatic floor cleaner computer program. Following the steps of the design process, they design computer programs and test them by programming a simulated robot vacuum cleaner (a LEGO robot) to move in designated patterns. Successful programs meet all the design requirements.”

Try to finalize this overarching project and all the details surrounding it by the midpoint of the Saturday meeting and add the details to cost/logistics spreadsheets as well as the schedule above 

Small Activities: 

Should be no more than 45 minutes and should be simplistic, encouraging engineering, robotics, and guiding students on a path to the FRC community and robotics as a whole!

Binary Bracelets (≈ 1 Hour)

* Introduce binary numbers on a brief slideshow (5 minutes max) and proceed to the activity ([https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1x2oKOuxlqAbPApCsIxuaZ-PybcTSrc7ZRmFU75Hiq6I/edit?usp=sharing](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1x2oKOuxlqAbPApCsIxuaZ-PybcTSrc7ZRmFU75Hiq6I/edit?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1717314697899659&usg=AOvVaw2-7_6pi7cO-ZauLlKghJ1L)) → Simplify wording to suit our target audience

Robot Driving (45 minutes on Tuesday)

A fun intro activity for kids to get inspired by robots, and what amazing things they can do.

Paper Airplane (45 min): [Paper Airplane Pitching - Teaching Engineering and Entrepreneurship](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.teachingentrepreneurship.org/prototyping-and-pitching/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1717314697900295&usg=AOvVaw1Y2wmlA3xx_Epb-3r6-eJh) 

Paper airplane engineering challenge. The plane should be designed to carry the weight of 1 dollar in coins. This activity will be a group competition which will be reflected in the spreadsheet as 15 groups of 4 (assumed 60 participants on costs/logistics spreadsheet). Will retrieve all quarters from competitors after competition is over. 

 

* Paper
* Coins
* Rubber bands
* Paper clips
* Tape

Twister + Spinner Coding (45 mins) - I feel like Scratch is overused but that is dependant on the group, I personally think that the Rubber Band Powered Helicopters will be easier to do and will offer a more engineering and robotics approach to the summer camp! Plus I think pseudocode will offer a better way to represent the coding aspect of the camp. 

An activity which first lets kids build a spinner on a spinner like Scratch. Later, they break into groups and play using the spinners they made.

Materials:

* Twister OR we can make our own “game board” to save money (10 games would be $150)
* Laptop + scratch
* Tutorial: [https://youtu.be/LyNqQkzzL34](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/LyNqQkzzL34&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1717314697901042&usg=AOvVaw2EB-b7UeDUr_4eU-4O_BLt)

1 volunteer per group → 10 volunteers

Rubber Band Powered Helicopters (45-60 mins) → Alternate activity

Going through the engineering process to make a helicopter which runs on rubber band power.

Materials:

* Popsicle sticks
* Rubber bands
* Paper
* Tape (5in per person)
* Propellers [(40 for $18)](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C69QC3T3/ref%3Dsspa_dk_detail_0?pd_rd_i%3DB0C69QC3T3%26pd_rd_w%3D7l6IU%26content-id%3Damzn1.sym.eb7c1ac5-7c51-4df5-ba34-ca810f1f119a%26pf_rd_p%3Deb7c1ac5-7c51-4df5-ba34-ca810f1f119a%26pf_rd_r%3DVZABY7PKZWA64CPM6CHS%26pd_rd_wg%3DkuODY%26pd_rd_r%3D621f99d8-cc08-4986-86e8-71f31e2f8626%26s%3Dtoys-and-games%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9kZXRhaWw%26th%3D1&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1717314697901815&usg=AOvVaw2KLSZScRBufeGXkKl8cdVF)
* Scissors

1 volunteer for 5-6 kids → 10 volunteers 

Cost and Logistics Spreadsheet: 

(Make sure that you are updating as you go for the cost and logistics) This sheet is extremely important when determining the price we charge, how feasible it is to make summer camp happen, and where we can get our materials → when finalizing activities make sure you include a link to buying the materials, try to find links where you can change the quantity of the products because we are not aware of the amount of materials needed yet.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U76CIPz-wvienG8Dy0yOQfjrT5nCLDuXcFx2Xsn\_OzA/edit?usp=sharing](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U76CIPz-wvienG8Dy0yOQfjrT5nCLDuXcFx2Xsn_OzA/edit?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1717314697902556&usg=AOvVaw0v4cnfCKW_tvJAy97TMkxt) 

– This spreadsheet assumes a estimated total # of participants as 60 and with the assumption that SPIKE kits are provided 

* Intention of using ACL makerspace materials (like paper, scissors, and tape) for certain activities so these resources are not included on the costs lists. If makerspace cannot support the quantity of resources, members will help provide the resources such as paper or tape to support the camp!
* Note: many items are sold in bulk, so there may be an excess of materials which can be stored for future usage to use as materials for other camps or for donation drives to support other teams.
* Total revenue and profit are included assuming we charge 150 dollars per student.
