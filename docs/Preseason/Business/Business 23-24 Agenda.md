Note: Coaches, leads, and officers will not be available today due to the leadership meeting. We also have 4 members at the Book Party. It is on you to distribute the work (I don’t care who does what unless it is specific below), but everything on this list MUST be complete by the end of the meeting. Everything for this meeting is bolded because they are all tasks that needed to be completed today. If something is not completed, it doesn’t reflect on me, but instead on you, so I would recommend that you start to work on these in the study hall and keep each other accountable. If you finish your task, help others so that you can finish quicker. Project Leads - don’t hesitate to ask other business members for help. If all tasks are complete, then brainstorm for Impact. You may text me if you have any questions, but it will be unlikely that I respond.
