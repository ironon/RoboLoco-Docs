# RoboLoco Docs
This is a concept for a documentation system for Roboloco that I believe could be pretty cool if we set it up right, as not only would it automatically generate a pretty cool website interface to interact with it, but it'd be able to pool data from Slack and Google Drive to automate a lot of the documentation process. I'll just talk about this system without Slack or Google Drive integrations for now.

Everything besides this page in the sidebar is fully "in character", how this documentation system could actually work in the wild, this page is just talking about the system in general and it's pros and cons.

## what i imagine this could be
the ultimate goal for this website is to fully document everything that happens, every day, in a way that is as easy as possible for every subteam. ideally, this website will automatically update to reflect anything happening in slack, in google drive, and anything else relevant, making it easier to learn from our mistakes ig. and...it's great as a team..bragging rights? (idk it's cool to have a website). last season nobody really did the portfolios because they were an extra step - if this system was implemented to its fullest, it'd greatly help with this issue. specifically, i think this system could be implemented with chatgpt really well, you could have it filter out the important stuff from slack and google drive and put it here, and then you could have it generate a daily log from the stuff here, lotta different things.

current progress:

 - [x] basic functionality
 - [x] google drive integration
 - [ ] a website theme that looks a little less garbage
 - [ ] slack integration
 - [ ] chatgpt integration
 - [ ] better google drive integration
 - [ ] tribute to david
## limitations atm
At the moment, publishing this documentation system is a bit obtuse. you either make a google doc and it gets pulled in, or you write a markdown file and it gets pulled in. that works, but i'd rather have an easy system. i wanna get a slack integration, and better google drive sync code, and a chatgpt integration that filters stuff, and I believe that would make this a really solid system.

I'm writing this documentation in Markdown, which in terms of ease of use, isn't great. the goal is to make it so someone outside of software with no software experience can easily edit this documentation, so imma try to increase the ease of use as much as possible, and while the google drive integration helps, this def still isn't to the level it needs to be
