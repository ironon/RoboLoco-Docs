1. You can enroll in this course for free and go through the modules.
2. Ask [KAVIN MURALIKRISHNAN](mailto:921563@lcps.org) or [ANEESH SULE](mailto:919507@lcps.org)about any questions you may have regarding the robot!
2. Look over this document and get familiar with it: [XRP Volunteer Hacks](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IQanXuk8u0vkvHlmvrWQxEbc7iuNVlytdGQOZtvFsjM/edit&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1717314602789873&usg=AOvVaw2ihv3RXxLvYtBrCKq2oB8I).
